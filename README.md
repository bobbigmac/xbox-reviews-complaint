    - Received confirmation of receipt email.

- Pending feedback prior to further escalation.
    - Recieved form reply redirecting to different department on a page that doesn't support complaints submissions

## The Problem

The Xbox Store's review system is failing developers and users in several critical ways:

### Game Pass Promotion Amplifies Issues
- Games added to Game Pass are prominently featured on the Xbox dashboard
- This visibility exposes games to immediate review bombing from users who haven't played them
- The "New to Game Pass" section appears just below the fold on every Xbox's home screen
- This promotion actively pushes games to players who may be motivated to down-rank based on prejudice
- Reported dog-whistle, masked hate-speech or sexualised reviews on childrens games do not get removed upon reports.
    - When requesting an update on report progress, they are flagged as not violating the policy.

The policy needs to change.

### Lack of Review Quality Control
- No playtime requirements for leaving reviews
- No filtering of hate speech or known dogwhistles
- No special protection for children's games

## Documented Cases

### Games with Diverse Protagonists
- [Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island](GAMES/GAME_MYTHWRECKED.md)
- [Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn](GAMES/GAME_FLINTLOCK.md)
- [Cassette Beasts](GAMES/GAME_CASSETTE_BEASTS.md)

### LGBTQ+ Content
- [Boyfriend Dungeon](GAMES/GAME_BOYFRIEND_DUNGEON.md)
- [Thirsty Suitors](GAMES/GAME_THIRSTY_SUITORS.md)

### Other Games (without review reports)
- [Games/Other Games](GAMES/OTHER_GAMES.md)

### Special Cases (Non-Game Pass)
These games demonstrate how Game Pass promotion unintentionally increases targeted harassment (these have much lower rates of hateful comments as described in their respective GAME documents):
- [Tell Me Why](GAMES/GAME_TELL_ME_WHY.md)
- [Dragon Age: Veilguard](GAMES/GAME_DRAGON_AGE_VEILGUARD.md)

### Children's Games Crisis
A particularly severe case of moderation failure:

## Impact on Developers

- Review scores affect game sales, developer contracts and future opportunities
- Small indie developers are particularly vulnerable to coordinated attacks
- Legitimate feedback gets buried under culture war noise
- Financial impact when review bombing affects store visibility
- Developers on Game Pass face heightened exposure to toxic feedback
