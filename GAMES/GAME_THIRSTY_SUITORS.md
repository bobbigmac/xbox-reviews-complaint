## Conclusion

Thirsty Suitors represents a complex case of review bombing, where legitimate technical issues on Xbox became entangled with cultural and identity-based attacks. The game's intersection of South Asian representation and queer themes made it a target for coordinated negativity, while actual performance problems were lost in the noise. The stark contrast with Steam's more focused, gameplay-oriented reviews highlights how Xbox's lack of moderation particularly fails games that deal with multiple aspects of representation.
