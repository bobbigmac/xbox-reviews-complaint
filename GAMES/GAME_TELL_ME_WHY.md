## Conclusion

Tell Me Why demonstrates how Xbox's Game Pass promotion system can actually increase harassment. Despite having content likely to trigger hate (trans protagonist, queer themes), its free-but-not-Game-Pass distribution helped it avoid the concentrated review bombing seen on titles like Flintlock or Mythwrecked. This suggests Xbox's moderation problems are amplified by their own promotional algorithms, actively pushing diverse games to hostile audiences without protection.
