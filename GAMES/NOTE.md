These review summaries were compiled by AI based on the reviews found in this repo. They're probably not exactly right, but are intended to indicate the scale of the problem. The Xbox reviews should be all publicly available reviews in my region (UK, I believe this includes US reviews, but that's a guess from context) at the time they were compiled. The steam reviews are mostly filtered to 'only negative' and are indicated in their filenames, because Steam gets a lot more reviews, and I wanted to give the Xbox store every chance to compare well, which it still does not.
