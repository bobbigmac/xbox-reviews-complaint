## Other games with severe disguised hate / dog-whistle reviews 

These are other Game Pass games that I have no detailed breakdowns for, that have also been review-bombed to some degree.

- [Open Roads](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/open-roads/9NRRSLCGR62S)
- [Tchia](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/tchia/9nk4wrqx5zc5)
- [Creatures of Ava](https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/creatures-of-ava/9nv5ltsphqd2)

The pattern across all these games is one of a problem _getting worse_. The more recent games have more active (and less disguised) hatred.
