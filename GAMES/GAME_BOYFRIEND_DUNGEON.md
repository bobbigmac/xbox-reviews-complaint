## Conclusion

While Boyfriend Dungeon faced less severe review bombing than some other titles, it still demonstrates Xbox's moderation failures. The mix of legitimate criticism, silly memes, and identity-based attacks shows how the platform's lack of moderation tools affects even games that market themselves as explicitly inclusive from the start. The contrast with Steam's more focused, gameplay-oriented reviews highlights the need for better review sorting and moderation on Xbox.
