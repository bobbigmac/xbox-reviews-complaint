# Quality Note

These review summaries and other content were compiled by AI (ChatGPT 4o and Grok 3) based on the reviews found in this repo. If you need exact figures, you can find complete review texts, or the printed versions in this repo, for your use. 

They're not perfectly accurate figures, but are close enough to demonstrate their intent to indicate the scale of the problem. 

Bear in mind, these reviews were all published publicly on the xbox (or steam) storefronts, but no ownership other than that of their respective authors are implied. If anyone wants their content removed from this repo, please open an issue or a pull request. The usual rules apply for digital content.

The Xbox reviews are all publicly available reviews in my region (UK, I believe this includes US reviews as en-GB and en-US seem to share content, but that's a guess from context) at the time they were compiled. Print-outs are saved as ideally Microsoft will remove all the original extreme content once someone with any kind of decision making capability becomes aware of this issue.

The steam reviews are mostly filtered to 'only negative' and are indicated in their filenames, because Steam gets a lot more reviews, and I wanted to give the Xbox store every chance to compare well, which it still does not.
