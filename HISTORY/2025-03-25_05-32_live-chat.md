Can you please tell me about the difficulty you are facing so that I can assist you better?

You said: it’s not about a single specific issue, but a persistent recurring issue, that isn’t addressed by any other contact. I’m happy to provide you with the full complaint, but it will swamp your chat tool, so I can give you a link to a public github repo with my complaint and supporting evidence if that would be acceptable?
