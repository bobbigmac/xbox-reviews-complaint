Hi Maurilio

This is not an Insider programme issue. This is a digital safety issue.

Are you handling email from the digital safety team, or the business compliance team? I've contacted both as advised, but only heard back from your department, which doesn't share an email or domain with either, so I just need to know which path this ticket was opened through?

I intend to escalate first to your customer advocacy team if no suitable response is obtained within 7 days of initial contact, so I need to identify which department you work for please.

The full intended escalation route can be found in the complaint project here: https://github.com/bobbigmac/xbox-reviews-complaint 

Regards
Robert Davies
