# Microsoft store policy regarding extreme/offensive/sexualised content in Xbox store reviews

Hi

I've been trying to report extremely offensive content in reviews on the Xbox store (inc_st, beas_iality, veiled hate speech/dog-whistles), and have been bounced between departments and told it doesn't violate the store policy (it seems the policy didn't anticipate these types of extreme content). If that's true, the policy needs to change.

I've written up a detailed breakdown of affected game store pages, mostly game pass titles (as they're more accessible for review without purchase)

You can find the complaint, entire context and supporting files, along with current status/history and intended escalation path if changes are not made here:

I have escalated to the AskBoard email account, because I've already been through every other department system I can find and I believe if a human being actually looks at this content, it's impossible to conclude it should remain on the store.

The next stage of this process is press and regulatory bodies starting with UK age rating authorities, as Xbox store children's games are particularly exposed to this extreme content.

Please find following the main body of the complaint attached.
Regards
Robert Davies
