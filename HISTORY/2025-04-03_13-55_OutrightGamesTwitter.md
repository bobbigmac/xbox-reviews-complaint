Hi. I tried to use the contact form on your website but it doesn't work.

Do you have an email address I can use to send a formal complaint about the presence of extreme/aggressive and sexual content on your games on the Xbox store?

I've been trying to raise it with Xbox directly (initially through their store reporting system, and through direct contacts with their support, such that it is), but they just keep telling me it doesn't violate the policy, so I need to escalate to have the policy changed.

As your games are far more affected than any other single studio's, I thought I'd contact you first before taking the complaint to press, as I've now exhausted Microsoft's support systems, but you may have more direct access via your game pass representative (as I understand it your contract restricts you from talking about it) as any human who actually reads these reviews can only come to the conclusion they should be removed.

You can find the detailed issue/complaint here, and follow the KIDS_GAMES section for details on how your games are affected.
