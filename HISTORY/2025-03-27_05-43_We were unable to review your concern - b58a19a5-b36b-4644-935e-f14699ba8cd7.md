There is a persistent pattern of violent, sexualised, aggressive, racist dog-whistles and otherwise 'disturbing' content in various game reviews across the xbox store, mostly (but not exclusively) on xbox game pass titles.

I have written up a detailed complaint of over a dozen games (including kids games). I am asking you to address the one I linked (read the reviews), but also review my detailed complaint, or I will have to escalate the complaint further, starting with the customer advocacy team, with further escalation detailed in my complaint.

You have already rejected a similar ticket once. Please pay attention to it, this is a serious violation of your responsibilities, and someone who can act on it needs to do so.
Regards
Robert Davies

- Note, tried to stress that a form response is not acceptable.
	- Linked to Bluey the Video Game as digitalsafety submissions require a single point of complaint.
	- Filed as 'other terms of service violation' as none of the specific options cover the subject of the complaint.

- Crikey, they sure make it difficult to report this stuff to an actual normal human being.
