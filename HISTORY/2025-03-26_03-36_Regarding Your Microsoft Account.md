Hi Maurilio

I already did that via live chat and they told me to contact you. 

This is not an Xbox Insider problem, and that page doesn't support submission of general complaints... This is a store policy problem, that is not limited to single users or accounts, and needs to be escalated, not redirected to a different department please.

Regards
Robert Davies
