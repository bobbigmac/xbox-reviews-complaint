Not fun
Tries to do way too much but fails at everything. Flashy but staccato combat constantly interrupted by void repetitive dialogue. Really bad skating is just the icing on the cake. If it was 3 or 4 different games, it might be playable but this is like a concussive fever dream. Have no idea why the other reviews are all triggered but regardless of whatever got them raging, it's just not a fun game to play. Boyfriend Dungeon and Cassette Beasts both do similar things but in a much better way.

The most unlikable main character I've ever seen. The world, dialogue and characters seem like they were written by horny children. Very 2D character designs with forced emotion and no thought. I'd give it 0 stars if I could. Play The Big Con instead of this.

Gameplay is fine but extremely convoluted. If this was meant to spread a message about modern dating, perhaps not fill your cast with really horrible people, Boyfriend Dungeon is better than this, that's a really low bar to cross.

Cringe and ioc
This game has good gameplay at its core, however it is not indicating if you are looking for a good story. That story is cringe. It starts off with a "thirstsona" where you get terrible choices, its a dating quiz with only three outcomes. After this your subconcious (the narrator based of the characters perception of her ex and herself) tells you that going to apologise to an ex is a mistake, you can either agree but not go through with it anyway or you can disagree. If your agree you get to "choose" who picks you up, spoiler: You dont get a choice. If i played further than that it would suprise me if the story got better. Moving onto gameplay, from the dating quiz (skating tutorial) the skating is horrible, third person between the legs camera and cant be moved. If the style and concept were worse it wouldn't even deserve a star.

Erm...
Woke = Broke. This reeks of a post-grad creation. The game style itself is passable, but the narrative and characters both include AND offend every minority possible. Its by default, racist and incredibly sexist. I honestly think the creators meant well, but the execution is awful. There are definite hints of interesting mechanics and creativity but need to wake up and join the real world before their next title. 3/10

The ending was lacklustre, some characters were awful and some were good, the mechanics were janky and would fail a lot.

As for the story [SPOILERS]

It made absolutely zero sense why there was a cult and Jala had to battle it out with them skate/battle style, even less sense that people that were 8-9 and 15-16 based their entire lives on one person they dated but whatever.


The friendship mechanics were off seeing as you couldn’t finish the route with Bruno either.

Hopefully there’ll be DLC

Excellent game!
I adored this and played the whole thing through in 3 days. Wonderful queer storytelling. character development, and multicultural narratives that are both beautifully fleshed out and very currently climate appropriate and educational. 
The ability to cook, dance, skate and battle kept me entertained and amused throughout Jala's whole journey. I just wish there was a little more on some characters! Tyler and Andile are delightful and I wish I got to spend more time with them.

Its a strange game
Honestly the reviews being so unhelpful and divisive drove me to try this despite not being the target demographic. Couldnt care less about political buzzwords etc, this review is strictly about the game itself.
Its weird. It attempts to form a unique gameplay loop by taking some different genres and tacking the barebones frames of them together to form a disorganised whole. Visual Novel elements and turn-based RPG elements form the backbone of the game but instead of complementing one another they fight for your attention with each turn of combat leading to back and forth dialogue - its glacial. Its all glued together by locations you mostly skate around (it sucks) and interactables, often with long QTEs (QTEs are constant in combat too).
Writing is quirky but decent. Music & voice acting is solid. If it had more focus & less bloat itd be worth playing. Its only 'woke' if you mistakenly regard including/supporting themes of LGBT relationships & positive communication as such.

OK... What the heck is this game?
This game was never going to get a fair review with all the anti- LGBT and racist bigots review bombing because they're so insecure about themselves. That said, just what is this game?!
We're meant to see this as a take on modern dating, despite everyone having 90's brick phones, but we get a weird mash up of genres that leave it a mess of a game.
For its 'too young' rating, you honestly get worse innuendos and sexual content in an average teatime soap opera, so alot of people are seriously sheltered calling this mildness 18+.
The problem is the weird mix of turn based battler, timing based cooking, and skateboard sim that chain together the story. With none of them being great, actual gameplay is deeply average. Combined the LGBT+ story and characters, many being poorly written and unlikable, you have to wonder just who this game is for?
That said, while very middle ground and disjointed, it was pretty fun to play. Though I'd not pay for it, or have tried it without gamepass.

Accessibility good for anyone who struggles with button mashing. Pleasant, fluffy game to relax with. The voice acting is good, a deal breaker for me. Can't see myself playing it over and over, but it's fun, a bit different.                                                                   On a side note, nobody shoves games down peoples' throats, we choose to play them or not.  As a pacifist I find war games distasteful. I don't play them, I don't expect nobody to make them.  Make your choice, never think you have a right to impose it on others.

I like how different this is. I hate having Woke Trash stuffed down my throat... and honestly this does not feel like that. Jala is Indian because her family are from India. She's definitely not "traditional" and it makes her an interesting character as a result. This game has a bright and decent looking cartoon art style. The premise and presentation are obtuse, a bit of a risk and consequently will not be to everyone's taste but good for Outer Loop for creating the Game they wanted to make instead of the Game their Metrics Team told them most people would like.

A Beautiful Mess
Like its protagonist, Jala, Thirsty Suitors is a somewhat messy game. It aims for so much, and while it doesn't always stick the landing, when it does it is SPECIAL. The moments when the game pulls all its disparate mechanics together are worth the price of admission alone. On top of that, it tells a story unlike almost anything else in games, with genuine catharsis coming from its dialogue-heavy battles and cooking segments. Ignore the guys who got mad because it's got queer people in it; Thirsty Suitors is the most fun I've had all year.

Helpful explination
I loved this game, at first I wasn't to sure how to feel about it. Then I got the hang of it. It's a fun and colourful story with a bunch of different activities to do throughout the game. The best part to me was the dialogue, it was sometimes so out of pocket that I couldn't help but laugh. At the same time I was also taken aback by how deep and honest it all was. A genuine reflection on how relationship are left unfinished a lot of the time. It is a fun, thoughtful and unhinged in the best of ways. This game will not be for everyone as I'm sure the other reviews will tell you. If you have ever been called a man child or something similar, this game isn't gonna be your thing. Regardless I recommend giving the game a shot, you may just be pleasantly surprised. I hope this helps.

Thirsty Suitors floored with me its bold, heartfelt storytelling and visual flair. I loved getting to know all the characters and watching Jala reckon with her past, and coming to terms with how we've treated people we used to love or are still in love with. The game world is full of things to do, almost like a baby Yakuza game - and the battle system is a fun spin on the JRPG formula. It's respectful of your time, and I wish more games would explore narratives like the one found in Thirsty Suitors. Looking forward to whatever Outerloop Games produces next!
