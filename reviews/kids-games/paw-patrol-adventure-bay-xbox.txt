Great game!!!
I have all three titles,though feel slightly disappointed with Adventure City Calls in this one i felt there was alot of effort put in but in The movie especially the intro & Ryder sounds luckluster as if he was in the wrong game.

Morbing time
The story is perfect, the tears that ran down my cheekys when best girl was abducted by goblins and the protagonist had to find her just to find out she was cheating on him with morbius. The cutscenes were amazing running at 69000p 420000fps Ray tracing enabled on the xbox series s. When his mother gets murdered by the local gangsters and he has to shoot them up wit da glickity glockity it was so emotional, especially when it turns out his best friend was in relationships with the other crew members. the gameplay was great in moments such as the shrekening where you had to spray the orphans with onion sauce and hunting the survivors. The ending is so emotional when he comes out as a subaru wrx sti and everyone accepts him for what he is. must buy

Perfect Game!
I have never played such a perfect game it has such great details relating to the lore of the pups that I have become very invested into the backstory of them all. The gameplay is also immaculate that I think this should be game of the year and possibly the century since there is no faults in it and I am addicted to this. I would recommend this to all my friends but I have none since I lost them all due to playing this game too much but that's ok the paw patrol are my new friends.

AMAZING WOULD RECOMMEND FOR YOUNG MOTHERS
Easily one of the best games I've ever played. It has amazing graphics. 4k in fact
. Amazing storyline. Truly heart breaking moments. Emotional damage. I would recommend this. To literally anyone. 99 To 0. It is especially good for children. You can't sit still and have ADHD. And you don't want them to play gory video games. Such as. Princess Disney Princess This game is arguably better. Than Dark Souls. As one of the best adventure games I've ever played.

this game is very quick i finished within 1 hour and 38 minutes so i dont think it worth £35 but if you get it on game pass or on sale then defently worth it. i did just find it too easy every level was very easy the final boss fight was no challenge did it effortlessly so there was no challenge in the game and in a game i like a bit of a challenge . i only knew paw patrol was a kids show so i didnt know much about it and thats a good thing about this game becuase you dont have to be a fan or a child to enjoy this game . the graphics were supprisingly good no bugs or glitches ever every thing ran very smooth. but only get if its on game pass or sale

Outstanding!
Everything about Paw Patrol Mighty Pups feels engineered to make me stop and admire its intricacy and detail. The graphics were jaw dropping and left me with a sense of bliss. I've spent the last 500 hours enthralled by this games rich story and beautiful character development, and cannot understand how people call this game "garbage" or "boring". In reality, it's the kind of game that rivals the likes of Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA V. Each character has a personality, such as Chase who is the hardened police dog, whose life turned to alcohol and drug abuse, and Marshall who suffers with many mental disorders. The game truly moved me and gave me a new perspective on life, after playing the 6th mission, where Chase has to save the Winter dog from commiting suicide, it shows a different side of Chase that we have never seen before, making it so that their personalities show how three dimensional they truly are. However, there was no pvp battle royale and was sorely disappointed.

Honestly as a 21 year old, even i can enjoy this and that's saying something because i have brain damage. Having to walk around in circles and collect dog treats was by far a highlight of my 2021. Even when they got their powers i was blown away. I would highly recommend this for anyone who has brain damage and has mentally regressed to a 5 year old.
