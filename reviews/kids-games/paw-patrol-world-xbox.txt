The hardest game ever crafted
Dark Souls players will cry and fall to their knees the second they find someone who has done the impossible, beaten Paw Patrol World. This makes Halo 2 LASO look like a baby challenge. Beating this game will take more skill than living in America as a minority within a town full of police officers. 
The combat is excellent and purely skill based, no luck, no cheeky metas like Elden Ring.
The story is a masterpiece, nothing half finished like Metal Gear.
The graphics are supreme, unbeatable, extremely realistic, Starfield can't even get close to this.
The leveling system is made purposely to get you to think your hardest, way better than anything out of Dragon's Dogma.
The only game this can be fairly compared to is 'My Friend Peppa Pig' which is the second hardest game in existence.

Lost my sanity
I an 18 year old thought it would be funny to play a game made for children out of boredom, however that was not the case. I spent 6 hours and 26 minutes of my life playing the hit game Paw Patrol World. I even got every achievement. Do i feel accomplished well yes but also no. I could've spent that night doing anything else but instead I subjected myself to this tomfoolery. Listening to Ryder and his pups go on and on about how the blimp guy cant have a cat party and about how hes "terrorizing the 4 areas which you play in" Like bro let him have a party it aint that deep. I barely had any fun playing this game it actually kinda annoyed me a lil bit but even though I hate to say it i still enjoyed it just a tiny bit. I know im being negative here and that's probably cuz im a teenager lmao thats how we are but im still giving it 5 stars cuz im sure there are people who would find this game somewhat entertaining. I can definitely see this game getting a sequel üò≠

Great open world game
This game is different from the other paw patrol games, it's an all open world game. Lots of main campaign missions and side quests for each pup. Lots of secrets to be found which gives the pups special rewards. I'd definitely recommend it for fans of the series. I'm 53 years old and I love it. No bugs in the game so far. Try it out for any who is a fan of the genre.

No game ever created comes close to this one. The challenges are harrowing and constantly pushing me to be a better player and a better person to conquer. Customization? You bet, buddy. I feel like I'm God with the options I have. I had to ground my kids for no reason so I could hog the computer to play more PAW Patrol World. Although honestly I would sell my children for some more DLC. My wife is already threatening to leave me, but I told her she can take the kids and everything she wants as long as I can still play PAW Patrol World. Their company is no longer needed anyway. In PAW Patrol World I can be anything. I can be anything. I can finally live up to my father's expectations. Honestly, who know that a game could be so immersive? I live here now. I know I'll never be lucky enough to play another game like this. 6/5 stars. Also, try drugs.

Helped me realize that beauty can be found anywhere, and that if you look hard enough there's a very slight chance you might even be able to spot it, but that rose colored sunglasses really help raise the odds significantly.  And that sometimes it's ok not to be ok that you waited all year for a shamrock shake and then have three separate McDonalds tell you that their shake machine was either broken or being cleaned. It also made me wish that dogs were real, except I wouldn't want them to talk.

Great for kids, but its a bit lacking of fun to do content.  Could have easily let sky fly or given us a racing\snowboarding minigame, but there's nothing like that in the game.  My kids were most excited to go in the paw patrol tower and the throne room in barkingburg and you cant visit either of those places.  This game had potential but felt rushed.  Worth no more than 20 bucks imo.  Kids ages 5, 3, and 2
Reason for 3 star is no replayability once the story is done for my kids

A wonderful step in the right direction for Paw Patrol games! Loads to do, unlock and find. Biggest best game yet. Only gripe is no actual Skye flying and no playable Sweetie or Liberty. I'm hours into it and still in first area. I just wish there was a game based off the two movies. A free roam like this, but with the style graphics and premise of the movies. Like a game for the older fans. More action and less hand holding. One with actual voice actors! Maybe a pup character creation and you meet the team and hang with them and others like a Paw Patrol RPG..

This was easily one of the year's sleepers on release, similar to Palworld but the fact that they listened to the community and added this new multiplayer mode is insane! I am having so much fun, and I don't care about the Kernel access like some bc I would rather it have a good anti-cheat than not. I can't believe this hasn't hit the top Twitch Streamers since the addition of this extraction mode, no one saw the announcement which makes sense bc it's not like ppl are constantly tracking news for this game or 3DClouds, but they should be! It's nuts! 18 in solos, 36 in Duos and Trios with tons of different build types and team comps seems like it's begging for some metas, but as I type that I also hope I don't get left in the dust once some more skilled players realize how great this game is!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This says it all right here
Have I played it?  Nope.  Will I play it?  Nope.  Do I care they added this to GP?  Not at all.  Because I realize not every game on GP is targeted at me.  And I hate to be the bearer of bad news but PS Plus is the same way.  I think I have 6 or 7 games I play downloaded on my Playstation with PS plus. Most of which are exclusives.  Look at it like this. If you are playing over 22 dollars worth of games each month with either subscription then you are getting your moneys worth. If not then CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. It really isn't rocket science. I play about 250 dollars worth of games on each sub so I continue to sub to both. Pretty soon you won't have a choice between GP or PS plus. You only need to look at the Madden games or the Atari even to know what that is going to look like. When you are the only show in town you can charge whatever you want and roll out innovations as you see fit. I play a ton of games on all platforms and PC and It will be a sad day when I can't choose.

An adult mad at a kids game lol
All these so called adults slamming a game specifically for kids is absolutely pathetic. They think every game on game pass should be AAAA blockbusters that only cater to them. This isn't for me. But my kids love it, so it's 5 stars. Xbox needs to clean these bots out of our community asap.

If you a grown adult and you're playing this by yourself and excited about it paint chips are your favorite snack. That's the rule I didn't make them.

Deserving Of A Chance
This is an Introductory Open World. It gets it's enjoyable factor mainly from the concept rather than the Gameplay. The feeling of playing as the Paw Patrol in an actual proper game. The Gameplay itself compliments it. The Driving is smooth and the Button Prompts active. The exploration being there if you want to play more or have some customization. The main issue with the game is the opportunities that are missed. You can't fly or use any gadgets outside of actions. Areas could be bigger and certain places actually be explorable. I would give the game about an 8/10 if I could. That's because of the Repetitive Nature of some of the actions. The Clothing Store in-game. (Why? Simple, it gives a shortcut to the Microsoft Store. It's not major because one would have to be pretty careless for any accidental purchases) The story also lags a bit near the end where the Main Story takes awhile to continue. Essentially, just play it. You might enjoy the experience to not care about the faults.

Easy GP Points with Some Gripes
Overall, this is a very cute game. It's certainly a near mindless way to work on those GamePass achievements/points (though later achievements are predictably longer).
As far as "Open World" or "MMO Style" ... it's a pretty contained world, though you can stick around as long as you like to get those 100% things. For the MMO types, it's a pretty handheld trip trough a main story and some side quests, and the side quests can be replayed (kind of annoying when you're trying to figure out which ones you might have missed).
Also annoying... you can't fast-forward through dialog - even the slow narration of "Hey Dummy, you pushed the wrong button" or "you're in the wrong mode" and those other things I need less than a half second to process (read: you have to listen to them babble on for the fie hundreth time).
Lastly, though they kinda "show" a camera control, it all still boils back to character mechanics and "always being behind them," sorta.

this is silly
this game is very silly and hard to complete. after many hours of grinding i realized something. why Taiwan should be apart of the peoples republic of china. I believe once my glorious leader (xi jiping) returns taiwan to its former glory the developers could add sweat shops to simulate chinas great work ethic. the children from these apple sweat shops will yern for this game after many hours of making my iphones. Since dog is already in the game adding the hunting and eating mechanic wont be hard to add if requested by the community. that is why i believe this game is silly

Switching to play station.
Gamepass has gone far downhill and now we wont get exclusives to xbox yet playstation still will while getting to play every game released on xbox. Switch before its too late and they jack up prices becuase of inventory.
