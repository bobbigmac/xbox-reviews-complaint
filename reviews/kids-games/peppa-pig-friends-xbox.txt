Truely a must play
truely a masterpiece which deserves recognition for its absoloulete prestine 4K ULTRA HD graphics and its breathtaking experience, truely catches the player off guard. My goodness how much more can i reccomend this journey. By far the best mission must be trying to find George's dinosour.

How could you not participate in this exquisite profession.
Thanks to this game I have had a major increase of wives.
The jumping in the puddle cruise really gave me a different perspective on how to view this unforgiving society, the analogy shows that society is just a dirty, grimy mess that is pretty shallow.

Thank you Todd Howard
Truly a turning point in videogame development. My Reformed-Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton, along with visionary demolitions expert George W. Bush, has once again knocked it out of the park with this awe-inspiring cinematic masterpiece. If you thought Dark Souls was hard then strap in for this; My Neighbour Peppa Pig by Studio Ghibli is literally unplayable by mortal hands, and that's a good thing. The absolute nirvana one achieves by simply playing this audio-visual ambrosia is indescribable, even the births of my many children (who, by court order I am no longer allowed to see) couldn't come close to the the pride I felt upon installing this divine masterpiece. Only those blessed few favoured by the gods themselves could even defeat the first boss (Daddy Pig). So please join me in begging Mossad for a sequel to this ludophilic jewel.

This is the true return to form that the Call of Duty series was desperate for and its great to see infinity ward, neversoft, raven and sledgehammer pour their hearts and souls into the compelling campaign and the fantastic multiplayer and spec ops modes.

Overall the game was the best game i've played and is definitely worth the ¬£3 I wasted on the game.

Truly a timeless certified hood classic
This experience was amazing to the point that i almost fainted while playing. It well and truly redefined the meaning of life and death, has a man really lived if he hasnt left a legacy like this game behind or has a man really died if he hasnt lived indebted to our savior lord peppa pig christ. Like a wise man once said 'when one tries to find a path to enlightenment, he must endure the best and worst life has to offer'. This experience takes you on a journey to being the best person you can and opening your mind to the greatness that this mortal plain has to offer. I believe that when god came fourth fom the heavens and bestowed this idea upon our greatest minds, he believed this would fix the world's problems like my marriage and the detiriating relationship with my children who despise me for ruining chirstmas by not gifting them this passage to happiness.

Best Game ever 100% recommend
Before i played this game, i was a sad, depressed loser with no milk or reason to live however after i heard the PCU (Peppa cinematic universe) had a game, i finally found a reason to live. Where can i start, the character customisation is crazy, the detail is insane and the voice acting is amazing. On my first playthrough, i played as Andrew Tate The Tarantula and i was blown away by the story, the game may be called my "friend" peppa pig but trust me, she is not your friend. After she calls daddy pig fat you have to team up with george to seek revenge. I don't want to spoil anything but the plot is similar to GTA V and similar games. After i got 2000 hours on the game, an entity known as milk has entered my fridge. You may think this is a kids game but the intense combat, gore and swearing in this game is 18+. The brutal warfare in this game is horrific and the ending is moving. In conclusion, i believe that this is game of the year and i would highly recommend

How do i begin, this game is one of the seven wonders of the world i mean it is truly breathtaking. This game has given me a new understanding of life itself, i have a new view of everything thanks to this masterpiece. As a wise Peppa Pig once said "If you are jumping up and down in muddy puddles you must wear your boots," we will never know what she meant by this but one can infer that she was talking about how you should never do something if you haven't prepared yourself. Peppa Pig will always be remembered by everyone as a visionary and a revolutionist she changed our species more than we could imagine. This game truly redefines our outlook on her Majesty and saviour Peppa Pig.

Truly ahead of its time. Very steady 260fps and 16k graphics. The main story and 5 different endings are divine. Multiplayer and zombies mode is also sublime. However a few negatives, like the side quest of daddy pig where you have to start money laundering is tedious. The second last boss, mother of the swine. Is too difficult. Also the death cannon needs a nerf. Personal favourite ending is where george is beheaded by isis.

My Friend Peppa Pig - A Very Serious Review
This game is an instant classic, with retro-styled graphics and a rich story and gameplay loop seamlessly intertwined, mirroring white nights by Fyodor Dostoevsky.
Its difficulty is unrivalled even compared to Dark Souls. The game is constantly deconstructing how you deal with each combat encounter. The Madame Gazelle boss fight is challenging to its core the limited weaponry and the damage of her shotgun makes this encounter impossibly strenuous.
The developers cackled maliciously as they sat in front of their long script written entirely in Brainfuck - the product of a long day's work.
Towards the end of this sublime story, the Grandpa Pig *** scene is bestowed upon us as a prize for all of our hard work and the slavery we have endured, one person I asked said "My hands were bleeding as I held onto the controller, unable to put it down as watched the credits of this, Outright Games' magnum opus."
If you want a beautiful game with a gripping story, this is the game for you.

My Friend Peppa Pig is not only a cinematic masterpiece, but also a heart-capturing game with a lengthy juicy storyline with tens of hundreds of hours of gameplay. You play as Peppa, a young pig destined for greatness, trying to make it through life. Truly a masterpiece worthy of being a top tier game among the ranks of Halo, COD, Warzone,  Minecraft, etc..  10/10

Frustrated children.
Kids wanted to get all achievements, Peppas little brother got his dino toy stuck in the tree, but the tree is right at the edge of the screen, The kids walked off the screen and it cancelled the mission and the teddy was reset back to the house with the little brother, no way of restarting this one, and how do you get to potato city?!? seems a little lazy effort as this game is for small children so it is like it doesn't matter. such a disappointment. frustrated children, which now means frustrated adults, too. This was supposed to be fun for the kids to explore the Peppa pig world they see on the tv every day! why make it so you can find places?

My life has now been fixed.
I am in my early twenties, I have had a rough life and have taken to being a total loser and party animal. I have come across this game, rather peculiar thing. It has set the fires alight inside me and encouraged me to fix my life. I have given up gambling and now have a savings account, my relationship with my wife is better than ever now that she only has one black eye. My kids are happier than ever now that they're not being taken away from me. Now I only take recreational drugs every other day rather than every day.

this is amazing
This game helped me so much since My mother chose not to marry my father. He begged her, but she had fallen in love with someone else. He tried to be part of my life when I was little, but after that, he basically disappeared from my life. My step father and I never got along, he was an abusive person, and we were all afraid of him.
Later on (as a teen), I tried to connect with my father. But he was very bitter, he refused to have anything to do with me. Would not even talk to me, and asked me not to bother him. I had no father figure.
Much later, when I was an adult, I worked up the courage to try again. I had gotten married, and had children (I was his only child). He was a grandfather, and didn't know it.
I searched for several years and finally found him. On the California Death Index. He had died, and no one had even told me. but this game helped me through it all thank you 10/10

I'm too old for Peppa Pig
I am too old for that show because I am going to be 17 in a couple of months. I used to love Peppa Pig when I was a very little kid but until I was 8, my parents stoped me from watching Peppa Pig it's not because I got too old for it, it's because I got obsessed with it and my parents wanted me to watch something new. When I have been forced to stop watching Peppa Pig, I had a meltdown because it was my favourite show. It is not my favourite show anymore. It was when I was a little kid. My nephew is 1 year old and he likes Peppa Pig and I watch it with him. I don't like Peppa Pig but I am always happy watching Peppa Pig with my nephew. Thanks for my review.

Good game, with mature themes
Overall, this game is extremely suitable and enjoyable for teens and young adults. However, it does explore many mature topics, such as the protagonist, you, trying to fit into a disregarding society. Furthermore, the is an underlying sense of racism, with daddy pig handing peppa a strawberry ice cream, and I, a black mouse, one of chocolate flavour. This behaviour should not be normalised by pop-culture such as this otherwise fantastic game. Thank you.

This game has a next gen update???
This game was something else. When I heard this game has 120fps 4k and ray tracing, I had to play to see why this game was game of the year. I was surprised when the game started, the first I saw was daddy pig. My god, he didn't fair well with the 4k support and now is the reason why I have nightmares. Then the announcer kept telling me to press A, thinking I was stupid. Little did the announcer know, I'm smarter than a 5 year old. As I played more, I was disappointed on how useless peppa was when building a snowman nor singing "do you want to build a snowman". Peppa would be more useful on a spit roast. Overall, the game disappointed me on many levels, as I hoped to spend the day with peppa, robbing banks :(

Lack of endgame content
This game could be a 5/5 if there was more to do after beating the main storyline, all my favourite games have been very similar to this in terms of gameplay and this had the potential be one of the greats, however the severe lack of endgame content after beating the main campaign really drags it down, i feel like a round based zombies gamemode or a multiplayer battle royale could really boost the overall rating of this game, a mode where me and my friends can have hours of endless fun on top of the top tier campaign

A Modern Masterpiece
This is a game for the ages. Think of a mechanic, walking, hot air baloon, ice skating, ants the size of shoes, driving that's on the level of gta, this game has it. The story of pepper and her friend is heartwarning and inclusive since her friend is a mute something no game has attempted to this degree. No unnecessary questlines, no handholding just like a souls type game, character creation on the level of Bethesa. And I'm pretty sure there's a raid boss after going for the 100% for you MMORPG fans. This game deserves the recognition these standard formulaic don't deserve.

Where do I start? Impeccable graphics, thrilling storyline and a variety of characters. This game has such a emotional experience. So Emotional I cried a uncountable amount of times. Furthermore, this game has a thrilling lore! From easter eggs to secrets. This even contends the greats in video game lore. This includes FNAF, RDR2 and many more!
 This right here I believe, is Game Of The Year Ladies and gentlemen.

Dissapointing
Basically a very shallow game which my 4year old got bored with quickly

Game of the Year
In simple terms this game is brilliant. The atmosphere in every single moment is perfect. Along with the soundtracks and other noises like Papa Piglet's snort. The developers have got this game spot on with this as it really throws you into the Peppa Pig Cinematic Universe. Then we get to the actual gameplay of this magnificent experience. This is indeed an experience, not a game. You'll only understand what I mean when you play it. With key moments that are displayed perfectly and with clever use of soundtracks, slow building tension and the further environment. It does indeed put the player on edge. Then you get to meet the Peppa Pig family. The excellent blend of very in depth character development, them, along with Peppa, you get to see them develop into even more complex characters. So unique.

Awful, really
Troll reviews aside, this just isn't a good kids game. No player agency whatsoever. You might as well put on some random 30 second clips.

Total scam
My 5yo is a big fan, so was excited to try this. Even she got bored after an hour...the most fun part is the character creation screen, everything else is garbage. This isn't a game, it's a boring, repetitive money grab
