Impeach Mayor Goodway!
Mayor Goodway has replaced Adventure Bay's entire emergency response services with a team of semi-anthropomorphic dogs captained by a six year old boy who may or may not be engaged in some suspicious activities. If there are two fires at the same time there is only one fireman to put them out, and he's a dog. Not only that, but the cop dog is racist and always pulls over Zuma but never Marshall. Mayor Goodway needs to go! The thing that makes this game 5 stars is how well the cars handle just like their real-life counterparts. Also, the powerups are sick, one causes your enemies to become crushed by a giant rock, and of course there is no way to receive medical treatment because all the funding went to Skye's jetpack.

The REAL Driving Simulator
When I first played this game, I was blinded by it's magesty. Absolutely paralyzed, dumbstruck, and blown away by the realism of the physics. As a 20+ year veteran of racing simulators, I can say confidently that Paw Patrol: Grand Prix is far superior to the likes of Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo, Assetto Corsa, even iRacing. Every vehicle handles identically to it's real life counterpart, perhaps even better. 13% of the US population commits 52% of violent crime. Unfortunately, the lack of a lap timer, leaderboards, or any online features whatsoever hold this masterpiece back from it's true potential as the greatest racing game of all time. 3/5

This game is not realistic whatsoever
This game makes me so upset. To start the dogs aren't realistic whatsoever, like they don't have private parts and when you crash a car they aren't even ejcted from the cars. I think to make this game a master piece a lovers campaign would be very cool. To elaborate you and chase can have a hot steamy relationship where you to various activies like grand theft auto or money laundering. To end the campaign Chase gets shot up in a horrible fight and you are driving while at the same time running from the cops that chase has now abandoned. The last scene shares a lustful kiss between you and chase where it is followed up with you dumping him out of the car and you drive off with all the earnings. I also agree with the one guy that there should be jiggle phsyics. Like seriously a fat dogs body should jiggle when he crashes into another car. I thing making the game hyperrealistic with private parts would be cool as well. Also the female dogs can go into heat and get distracted while driving

Muhahaha
As a 27 year old I prefer these games because I get to dominate whereas in other games I'm no good. 😂Jk I haven't even played but I couldn't see myself giving a bad rating to a game made for children unless it had some absurd content. Like if you're at least a teenager & don't like it I suggest playing something designed for your age bracket. Can't really hate on gamepass for adding content for children. Well I guess you can if you wake up everyday looking for anything to hate on😂 Updating & adding I decided to check it out since it is 2gb & takes like 5 minutes to download. It actually looks quite amazing graphically + runs & controls great. Doesn't have online multiplayer but would be fun 2-4 person split screen for children or adults alike. Simple & fun. No online mostly breaks racing games for me since I live alone but I don't feel predominantly childrens games should have that access anyway. This would be a fun game for any group to play split screen on though.

Replying to Brodie2527
first of all your 1 star review is wrong, this is a 5 star game at least. second, the game is supposed to simulate the puppy races of ohio. yes you may get shot a couple times before the race but this is a small price to pay for the amazingness of PAW Patrol: Grand Prix. Also the police do not exist in ohio, you should already know this, they just stand around doing that free money glitch. and finally, running citizens over is normal in ohio (it is also a great hobby to look into). so after knowing this you should get your butt back on the game and experience a little taste of ohio.

Hmm
I guess fans of paw patrol might like it. Its a little boring. Different levels of difficulty great for all ages. Theres a couple of things i dont like. The first is the acceleration being the A button. Very awkward to hit the B and X buttons while keeping on the A. Also how to look behind while accelerating and push the right stick to look behind. I think more difficult for the younger kids and less experienced. Why not use the right trigger like most racing games use? Secondly using a pick up. You cant throw behind so you can hit your own item. Game is way over priced. Thank you gamepass for saving me.

Pretty much a mobile game
Two things I liked: Chaining drift boosts is fun (and gamebreaking which is fun too) and there's a decent amount of tracks.
I'm glad it's on game pass so kids can play a few times before they never touch it again. Hot Wheels is a lot more fun, that's on game pass too.

Better than Mario Kart
Dog patrol does it again by bringing the real action in kart racing with this game. Power up’s are simple and straightforward without 100’s of ridiculous options for filler content. The rubber band AI drivers really make your actions matter when navigating the course. One wrong move could determine if your come in first or last place in a race. The graphics are as realistic as they come. It feels like real life racing in my living room. Play this now!

So I decided to grab this from gamepass to play with my 3 year old cousin. Upon playing, I noticed it steering by itself.It turns out there is an auto pilot mode which is nice. Playing more, inoticed the boost in the beginning glitches often, not going up when i hold A. I also noticed that the framerate is very inconsistent, often falling below 30 fps. Graphically, the game is beautiful, but it misses the mark

I been going through a hard time recently, struggling grades and girlfriend left me. I can't even pay for my classes. On top of all of that my doctor laughed when she had to inspect me for genital warts. I can't even afford good kibble for my homunculus (his name's Jared). But this little bas**** has put me in this situation. So i loosened my belt and whipped him. It felt... good. I continued until all i saw was red mist. I blacked out with rage, and awoke to Paw Patrol: Grand Prix. This game, its... My favorite. Why would this be on? I saw jared, barely breathing starting a match. He pointed to a controller. I grab it and he clicked play. I had so much fun, i forget all about my worries and enjoyed myself. He beat me in the race but i didn't care. It was so refreshing, and he always was better then me at PAW patrol: Grand Prix. But i saw him laying there. Bloodied and near death. God what have i done. He whispered with his dying breath. "live Bartholomew, for me" Thank you PAW patrol

Okay For Kids
If your kid absolutely wants this game, and you have the cash for it, I suppose it's worth it.  It looks fine and plays decent enough for what it is.  That being said, it's incredibly repetitive and I can't imagine even kids past the age of, what, eight really enjoying this over something like Mario Kart.  Even if you just wanted to play this for easy achievements, it's really not worth it given the price (even on easy with auto-drive enabled, you're still not guaranteed to pass each match without some intervention, as mentioned online).  Glad I finished it before it left gamepass, but I definitely regret starting playing it on a lark.

Game racing speed is really slow.
When you are clear out in front leading, the game it seem to slow you down.
It like rubberbanding to make the A.I. catch up.
That just a bad game design. Holding A button for throttle instead of using RT like every other racing game has been doing is another bad designed choice.
You also cannot change or remap the in game controls.
Also no online racing mode in the year 2024? That some ancient level lack of innovative choice lol.

it has that lame feature that I don't like were every character plays different so if your favorite character is not the best or even kinda bad then you are screwed.  the physics broke a couple times, but nothing to messed up.
I wanna say that it was so nice to play a Mario kart clone that didn't have completely broken rubber banding.
id still rather play this than Sonic Team racing or Crash Cart because OMG those games have horrible problems.

This game is awful. Youd feel more alive throwing a rock at a wall than playing any of these courses. The game doesnt account for you being able to drift any more than one light-year at a time, so Marshall is CONSTANTLY going "WOAAAA-HOH!" Every nanosecond. This is coming from somebody whose achieved"Unstoppable", which is beating 17 levels in first. 13-16 are duplicate tracks by the way. Would rate lower if I could. Also, runs at a smooth and silky 35fps, 480p consistently. My grandma's nokia phone runs games better than this. To whoever made this monstrocity; I hope you take a long look in the mirror and meet yourself with dread. This game sucks. ********.

There are many games with a better structure. Rubber banding is common where you'll be in first until the very last turn and someone who was far behind suddenly shoots ahead to win. The "Blue Shell" mechanic is also here, most of the characters special abilities targeting whoever is in first place. If you're playing solo I would give this a HARD pass unless you love PAW Patrol.

Outrageous
As a pro sim racer who uses a steering wheel, I am enraged by the lack of compilability with my G29 racing setup. I demand that they add steering wheel support so I can finally race professionally!

It's for young children

Like its for children. Like  you can tell what this is all about. My rating is low because of over price. This Paw patrol, u guys mess this up. And if I have a kid I would have played Mario Kart on 64, far more better than this. This doesn't target family, it failed badly

Chase Is an *******!!!!
I think the game is really, really great. But the only problem I'm having right now is that Chase is a huge ******* ******* 'cause he slows you down with his ******* power up. You're just trying to play as Rocky and you're trying to shoot out the ******* leaves out the back And then? ******* Then Sky just shows up and she just throws, throws herself in front of you and you're like, ***** how the **** did you get up there? She's basically in front of you and then you just have to barely beat her, 'cause you just gotta keep drifting, 'cause it's ******* tutorial doesn't teach you how to drift at all, but the drifting is like the keys, you gotta hold down the right trigger. And drift and then push yourself forward. The boost and then you're like alright, no one else knows how to boost, but then the other, the other racers don't start boosting until. Like the 10th track when you're doing, when you're. You're playing the tracks. This boosting is literally like the key to winning any Race.

Kart Racer fanatic here
This is very average. Terrible physics. Reminds me of the Wii era and the shovelware  kart racers for it.  Maybe fans of the show will like. Also I thought this franchise was cancelled after the Summer of Love 2020 lol.
Edit to add. Omg god it steers itself. You just hold the right trigger and win. No wonder it felt so janky, i was trying to steer!

Not a bad game for achievements
Game isn't bad, for the achievements. My only gripe, a lap system could have been added. Being allowed to change the laps to 1 lap per race would have been great. 17 races, 3 laps each on the same reused levels would have made playing this more bearable with that feature being implemented.
I get that it's targeted to younger audiences but just a thought for any new games that might get made. I don't care much for Paw Patrol but the achievements I do.
To any fellow hunters, games relatively easy to obtain all achievements but it is a serious grind. Especially doing adventure mode with all characters. Seriously thought I was gonna lose my mind finishing this 100% lol. Thankfully I am done with it. 🫡

Eehh 2.5 stars
Achievement hunters id avoid this game it is not a quick 1k gamerscore there are 17 tracks (most of which are repeats) and u have to win with all 10 characters. Thats 170 tracks and 510 laps and its painfully slow it takes about an hour per character. Also theres an awful achievement to win a 4 screen split race, there is no online, and guest accounts dont work u need 4 accounts and 4 controllers. While the characters are cute and may be your kids favorite, they become extremely annoying they have 2 or 3 lines that they repeat with every skill, power up, and boost u use. The controls are awful it literally pulls ur car, u cant drift but the AI racers can, and they get so many boosts and slow down power ups i can see this game being rage inducing for children. The human should not participate in a PUP race, some of the characters have overpowered skills. The pup missing legs is attention seeking, trust me people do look at you and Chase pulls u over for not having a handicap sticker.

I looked at chase happily so I had to join his klan. As a 67 year old male I could barely keep my edge streek to skye. My kids are moved out now in college and I used their rooms for my jars. Also my wife is dead so i put her corpse in a skye costume And i start "loving" it. The game made me steal 10 cockapoos.
