Good but buggy
I was walking around when bingo shoved a plant pot in me, sending me to some sort of shadow realm or backroom, forever tainting my soul and banishing me to the purgatory of hell. Great voice actors though. A must have!

Bit short off the mark
Glitches, freezing floating in mid air characters to the point a game restart is required. Kids game,which they did partially enjoy having great love for the series (myself incl.). It was just too short and felt unfinished/ untested before release. Another what appears to be rushed mess that's in need of patches from the devs. Lets hope its not a cash grab & we get the updates it deserves!

Bluey on a budget
You would think with the obscene amount of money they have made from Bluey merch they could make a decent high budget video game adaptation...‚Ä¶...but no. This feels rushed and put together by a few people over a weekend.
Its janky, and possibly the worst thing about the game is the bizarre sound levels of the voice acting, some lines are really loud and some are really quiet, sometimes both within the same sentence.....it all feels very soulless and doesn't capture a single gram of the magic of the TV show.

Bug-Ridden
Very short, but true to the show.  Kids struggled to enjoy it as much as they should have been able due to endless game-breaking bugs and poor design choices; It should either have been split-screen or prevented a player from moving off in a different direction if it meant that the other player would be out of view off-screen.  75% of the game was my kids shouting at each other to wait as their character had gone out of sight and they didn't know where they were.  Very shoddily made, glad I got it via gamepass and didn't pay full price.

Bluey:The Videogame is a good game üëç
Had fun collecting collectable and exploring and making Bluey throw books and toys and some of the furniture outside the front front of the Heeler House and I thought when I saw Bluey's Mum and Dad going outside going to fetch the stuff before people started taking things that don't belong to them and that would of happened because of Mischiefivios Behaviour but Bluey and Bingo were only playing some of you may disagree.

Thinking of watching the TV Show on Disney plus.

it's cool, but could be better.
playing this game from start to ending, there is a few things that's cool, and a few others that could of been better. and understandably, this game isn't for hardcore gamers out there, but it is a decent experience to spend some spare time if you're bored. the content here is a bit small, but that is to be expected to make it friendly for the younger audience. in general, if you want to spend some time that you got spared up, this game can be a good pick me up, but don't expect a whole load of content.

Just a bit broken
Don't quite understand this game.  Graphics and feel is all okay, but there are parts on the game where the mechanics seem broken and almost impossible to do what looks like a simple jump from a bench to a hedge.  If you download this, you'll be playing chunks of  the game for your kids.  Pixar Rush is a much better example of how to make a decent game for the young player
