I hate to be this negative about a franchise I love.
This game is upsettingly underwhelming, I've loved Dragonage since its inception and this probable final instalment is dreadful. Its too linear lacking in choice to be a true RPG, Shame as Bioware used to be the experts at this. The graphics are decent enough but the games art style is awkward and childish, a Far cry from the dark grit of DA Origins or The Beautiful Magesty of Inquisition. In summing up the game is a brutal let down, I was hoping for a Smashing comeback from Bioware after recent failures and missteps but after Playing Veilguard im left with the feeling that they don't deserve one.

This is an insult to the Dragon Age franchise.
Choices mean nothing, no intense moments, people have been turned into emotionless toons, its a let down and a insult. I hope no dlc is made. The mc has no mean bone.. Why do this to a beloved franchise? Guess DA is dead.

Dragon Age for Kids!
Updated review after full completion of the game.
What a bizarre conclusion to the DA franchise! We gone from the dark fantasy world of DA Origins to this goofball, simplistic, juvenile, childish mess that looks like it was slapped together over the last 10 months rather than the last 10 years.
After completing the game I don't ever expect to play it again, a sad indication of just how dull and shallow it is considering I have multiple playthroughs of the previous installments as different classes & races but there is nothing about Veilguard that makes you want to replay it.
It honestly feels like the people involved in making this have either never played a DA game before or have but hated every single thing about them. It is so unlike previous DA games that it is genuinely confusing how it has ended up in this state.
In conclusion: if you love DA and RPGs in general then give Veilguard a miss, it doesn't really count as either. A sad, bad ending to one of gamings' best franchises

Somewhere between disappointing and disaster
I have played the previous three dragon ages and was genuinely looking forward for the next insallment but after spending 2 days in the character creator trying to create anything that could resemble feminine and not a ball head i went...that will do and pushed on. The story so far is flat and linear leaving little choice for you to agree or disagree and you decisions have little to no imact from being forced down a single path. Itwears aveil of Dragon Age but so far has been something completely different and by no means a game i would have chosen to buy if i would have known how much had changed for the worse.

The writing is Bad and sometimes decent
So far I've had the same conversation 3 times and Harding Keeps Repeating what I just told her back at me as if it was her idea, I feel like I'm being Gaslighted by her.
My characters eyes aren't looking at the same direction, He's slightly crosseyed...
Everytime someone speaks it's like i'm being Patronised.
The antivan Crows are all really kind people who protect and care about eachother.
Quests will have you running over your own footsteps and visiting the same zones more frequently than DA2.
Cutscenes are bloated, you'll leave a cutscene, walk around a corner and be in another cutscene.
Combat is fun at first but stagnates and becomes boring and repetitive later on, these games are long and you have to basically button mash constantly.
I was told how to do the Wisp puzzle early in the game and now I'm being taught to do the wisp puzzles again.
It's like they had different writers write different parts.
Mage can't identify Magic.
This game just left me feeling Exhausted.

A genuine atrocity. This sterile, toothless and infantile excuse for a game is a true insult to the legacy of old Bioware. The dialog is so unbearble my eyes are in danger of rolling out of my head.
Every aspect of the game is simplistic and linear, with the smallest illusion of choice.
The world does look good at times however, truly cementing that this is just a Dragon Age skinsuit. Not the grim mature fantasy you remember, just a pathetic disney-like entry to the series.

Bit Boring at times...
*Story* I'm about 7 hours in and hardly experienced much so far it seems to be the original plot for The Dread Wolf before re-naming to Vailguard and its understandable as you will see in the opening intro *SPOILER* Solus get sidelined as a dream sequence with minor interactions insteadof being our antagonist that was lined up at the end of Inquisition. So, in my game this is my experience so far and quite lacking in entertainment. *Gameplay* It's not to bad considering what games are currently out with better mechanis for combat, this is not bad but could be better. *exploration* Dont expect open world as its very limited on where you go. Think DA1&2 map travel but more to offer as you will find yourself returning to access locked off areas. *Verdict*  It's ok, I personally feel when I'm playing it's not Dragon age it feels off somehow. I dont know who wrote the plot or even lines as its boring in certain areas and cringe worthy. Wait for the game to go on sale its not worth the price

Andromedas sequel?
Poor writing is really disappointing. Story feels forced and relations with companions inorganic. The animations for characters talking doesnt match their speech well at all and the voice acting doesn't reflect the conversations well. Combaty is changed to revolve around the protagnist so we lose the depth of strategising around our previously 4 person party (now 3). Higher difficulties are much easier than prior games, having warrior gameplay centre around tossing a shield even if they spec as a two hander is stupid, but maybe the devs enjoyed playing god of war? It's a glorified single player game dressed up as an RPG game, which is quite sad since we have waited 10 years for this. A spirituial successor to andromeda, I can't see myself buying another Bioware title now, which is a shame. They used to make great games.

Overall, I found the gameplay good. The combat system is very different which was refreshing at first. The graphics are stunning, and the Rook voice actors are fantastic. However, it really didn't feel like a Dragon Age game. The key pieces that make DA what it is were largely missing: Past choices are missing or incosequential, I never really felt morally challenged or that I had to balance morality/strategy, Rook is a lovely protagnist but feels like a set person, the romances were lacking and my second playthrough was largely the same as the first. Breaks my heart to say it but this was, for a long term fan,  more dissapointing than enjoyable. I do feel like long term fans were sold out for newer ones. As this is the final installment it really could have ended with a bang, but it feels more like a 'meh'.

The only reason this game has high reviews is because it's got the Dragon age name attached, characters are like wax figures, act like marvel characters and look like fortnite, the character i made no matter what he looked off.
Hate the combat, party members just force their way in with no option to tell them to leave or kill them off, loot is boring (i played to the veil jumper camp) it's find 5 gold and a potion in a green clay pot constantly.
Worst of all they brought back isabela, downgraded her in all aspects and pretty much made her a beta female who bows to traash i mean "taash" who is a complete tyrant character, this is a game so horrid, so boring that EA shill angryjoe couldn't defend it in his review, the game having a 5 hour trial (thankfully)and being discounted already says it all, clearly people don't care if bioware gets shuttered otherwise they wouldn't release this poor excuse for an rpg.

I really wanted to like this game but the more I play, the less I enjoy it. THE GOOD: exploration, some very interesting lore reveals, the much maligned art style really grew on me. THE BAD: the writing veers between fine and genuinely horrendous, combat is a slog of constant dodging and blocking with occasional time to fit in an attack of your own, the various in-game factions are sanitised to the point of parody to ensure you never have to deal with anyone morally grey, the grown up moral quandries from previous games around religion, oppression of the elves, dangers of uncontrolled magic etc are absent completely, the companions are mostly devoid of personality, the Marvel-esque tone is at odds with the world-ending plot, and this is very much *not* an RPG - it is a linear game where the only dialogue options you have are 'which tone of helpful do you want to be?' Overall a huge step backwards from Inquisition in pretty much every way.

Truth behind my words
As a huge fan of the Dragon Age franchise, i feel compelled to share my disappointment. 10 years the fans waited for the finale, and we were gifted with this garbage. They should have given us the end game in the same style as the previous games, but instead they gave us a Disneyfied Fortnite style game, that eliminated the true feel of the game. There is darkness in this story, only brightly lit graphics and cartoon styled characters that have no depth. This game would have been suited better as a childlike reboot for the newer players, instead of ruining it for the original fans. Like other reviews i've read on social media, i fear what mess will be presented to us in the next installment of Mass Effect! Perhaps it time for BioWare to give up the ghost and close their doors, and shut up shop for good. Their time has been and gone......

I've played each DA on release and loved them without reservation but gods of might & magic, I was bored senseless 3 hours in. I desperately wanted to be wrong about my suspicions. I wanted everyone who poo-pooed it on social media to be wrong, however. If I was new to gaming or fantasy rpg or under 12 I'm sure I'd have a smashing time. But I'm not.

So spoilers! My review of Dragon Age Veilguard!
For me it was a huge disappointment! I see many complain about it bring 'woke' for me it was the lore and the story! I loved everything about the elven lore but was not pleased how we didn't know more about the other gods or being able to bring down the veil or help the titans and the blight! They completely ruined Solas as a character for me! Such as matters on blood magic, his reasons for destroying the veil, him stating that he is a god!

This is not Dragon Age. It's Veilguard.
This is the Dragon Age equivalent of what Rings Of Power is to Lord Of The Rings. The lore is a mess, both underutilised and a horrible misrepresentation. I doubt the writers even played the earlier installments. The characters aren't characters, they're caricatures and terrible unironic parodies of beloved companions from prior games. They're immature and infuriating and you are forced to tolerate and endorse them. Solas may as well be schizophrenic with how inconsistent he is from previous concepts/depictions, from his actions to his core motives. Morrigan is also a victim of character assassination. She is everything she never would nor should have become. The cast is shallow and unlikable, and speak with jarringly modern terms/ideology in a fantasy setting; Quote - "I'm NON-BINARY". Some of the NPC's are more endearing, and I bet even then it was unintentional. This is an RPG with no meaningful choices, and it is NOT a Thedas you helped shape in any way. I regret buying it.

Well, where to start. I loved all the dragon age games( da2 was abit disappointing but ok). This feels like an empty husk compared to the 1st 3. Combat starts off ok, but becomes boring very quickly, conversations are boring and condescending,talking to me like I am a child. Companions are unlikeable and boring.  Enemies are bullet sponges like in a live service game. Overall if your da fan, you probably. will not like this. I played this for 70 hours.  Locations look beatiful, BUT you go through them so many times it becomes bland.

Ain't bad, but too clean
I was hasty with my initial review, it earned itself another star.
Overall it's a good, bordering on great RPG. It takes a lot longer than it should to get going, and some of the choices they've made are questionable, but in the end I had a lot of fun.
It has to be said that it doesn't feel much like a DA game - It's way too squeaky clean. They've done away with anything remotely controversial and shied away from the dark themes of the previous games. Same goes for companions too, you spend a lot of time together but it lacks the depth of the other games. Romances have suffered the most. 
 However, when it lands it lands. Some of the cinematics are amazing and there are some choices throughout that are brutal. The game also does a good job of making Rook feel like an existing part of the world.
I'd say definitely grab it on sale if you're unsure, or just buy it now if you think you'll like it.

Not dragon age quality, pushing leftism agenda
This is an alright game if you’re new to the franchise, I’ve played every previous title and all the mass effect games. This is a decent looking game graphics wise. Characters are alright I guess they aren’t baulders gate worthy characters. I don’t understand why being non-binary has been introduced to these games which are set in a medieval playing field. It’s very immersive breaking. These ideas are mostly not accepted and yet you are pushing these leftism views onto your fans. I want to play games to escape reality and yet all you have done is shove your views down my throat. I truly am disappointed non of the characters have the depth of previous titles the dialogue scenes are either great or terrible. Combat is so stale with allies abilities. I had fun but it wasn’t a great deal of fun. I’m disappointed as inquisition was so fun and good and had rich characters who weren’t all pansexual. It’s good to have straight and gay characters but now everyone’s just pan.

Bioware what are you guys doing?
Every single aspect of this game has been aggressively streamlined in favor of a more shallow experience. More often than not, Veilguard feels like it's having an identity crisis. It's an RPG without the role playing. It's an open world game without the meaningful exploration. Combat is initially fun but gets extemely repetitive FAST (even moreso since there are no build templates for you to save).
This game isn't bad... it's slightly above average. However, mediocrity isn't how Bioware got their claim to fame. Mediocrity isn't the standard that Bioware set for themselves.

Good game, not so great Dragon Age
It's a very well designed game in terms of combat, design cohesion, flow, etc. It can often feel like a spiritual successor to Fable II or Kingdoms Of Amalur. As an action game with quite good exploration, it's a lot of fun - looks fantastic, too, and it's technically incredibly polished. However, it isn't the very disappointing tone of the writing, or the character/items/enemies (the world itself look great) artstyle, that's my biggest issue; it's how disinterested the game seems towards the universe of Dragon Age, specifically events, groups, characters, social dynamics, etc of the trilogy. That is a serious problem, and one EA/BioWare really need to turn away from in the next entry. It sanitises lore/history of that world, too (e.g. the Wardens/Crows, to name just two examples), which seems absurd as that's always been a primary focus. It feels like EA/BioWare hierarchy didn't have confidence in DA's identity across the trilogy. 4/5 as a game to play. 2.5 or 3/5 as a Dragon Age.

200 hour review
Veilguard has 3 purposes: 
(1) To indoctrinate you into accepting that non binaries are real and that there is no such thing as male and female. The best example I can give is Governer Ivenci in Antiva. The governer is a man in his 50s with a male voice, a bald head and a full beard. His dream was to force his way into the girls' shower room so he started calling himself a 'they'. The governer let the qunari invade Antiva and is responsible for many deaths and suffering, yet even his enemies refer to him as 'they'. Before the finale, you are given a dialogue choice where in all options you must address him as 'they'. If you do not acknowledge the governer as a 'they' you cannot continue the main story.
(2) To make you question your own gender identity. The best example I can give is I created a male character. 4 hours later I received a notification reminding me I had gender identity options and to reconsider my character.
(3) To make a great DA game. 
I feel that DA was hijacked.

Mediocre
Pros: It's a decent, fast and flashy action rpg. It covers some lore bombs that the franchise has been alluding to for some time; i particularly enjoyed the return to the wardens and how their history was fleshed out and built upon. It gave that full-circle moment and some closure.
  CONS: It's just not a good Dragon Age game. It doesn't feel like Dragon Age. Characters fall flat because 100% of the dialogue between yourself and them is cutscene content. You can only react to their respective story arcs, there is no real conversation. Unlike previous DA's where there was dialogue to exhaust to get to know them better, ask questions, gain lore tidbits on the rest of thedas through their experiences. Veilguard unfortunately just fell so far short of the other games in terms of writing. Also many of your previous choices do not matter. Also many immersion breaking issues in gameplay. Chests that bounce open like in a mobile game, ziplines everywhere? As said already, it's Disneyfied

Okay game but missable items? Seriously?
I had high hopes for this game based on my experiences of the previous DA games (didn't really like DA2 tho).  Sadly my hopes have been dashed.  Yes its pretty and yes its bug free.  The story isn't bad but its not fantastic.  Some choices carry more weight but then limit your character if you are going for a particular build.  On this point the worst thing is chests that you may have missed during a quest but after that quest is complete you cannot get back to the area to get the one item you really want to improve your gear.  This is a stupid design decision probably put in to make you want to replay the game but it doesn't.  If you've played one build, then if you are replaying you probably want to try something else.  So the missed items were only really important when you actually needed them.  Overall I've enjoyed Dragon's Dogma 2 way more than this as it feels more like a proper RPG (albeit a less forgiving one).  Possibly buy this on sale, a really cheap sale.

The combat in my opinion is excellent, the companions do have an interesting story to follow and your decisions in game still have an impact like in the previous games. My main gripe is that theres not enough to explore and i found myself going to the same areas for multiple quests, time and time again. From a DA veteran, i do approve!

Changed the feel, but not how I feel about it.
This is not like inquisition, but Inquisition was not like Origin. Does that make it a bad game, no. So if you go into this game thinking its Inquisition, then obviously you are going to be disappointed. It still has much loved characters in, and has the follow up from Inquisition, also the charm of the dragon age world. There are some points about it I don't like, but ifyou are here you've probably play Origin and who didnt hate the mages tower, or the super cringy *** scenes... But I've completed that game at least once a year since its come out. I still love this game, is it perfect no, is it worth a play... Definitely! Good story, still characters that adore, better fighting too. Yes its cringy in places, and a bit woke but all the dragon ages have been LGBTQIA. So I'm not sure why one non-binary person has blown the gaming internet up... Anyway, don't listen to the haters hoping for Inquisition part 2, all DA games have been different from each other, so this is too. Rant over😂😘

Fun gameplay, poor writing
Long time DA fan. Finished game, and was underwhelmed by the narrative while mechanically enjoyable. Characters lack maturity, or the moral or ideological tension of previous entries. 'Friendships' feel forced and inorganic. Complaints about 'wokeness' misplaced, could've worked with bolder and darker choices to precisely emphasise theme but leaves it shallow and toothless, like the rest of choices in game. (Taash was the worst character they could've chosen for that theme, as their emotional immaturity and flippancy makes the theme itself emotionally immature and flippant, thus alienating player emotional investment.). Lore development interesting but again poor writing robs it of emotional impact. Unfortunately this might be the last DA game ever, a great universe that dies with a whimper... a shame: better, bolder, darker and mature writing could've saved this mechanically fun game.

Hard Crash series X
I want to make people aware that alot of players are having hard crashes/full console shut downs during playing. This has happened to myself also multiple times within less than 10 hours played. Not sure if this is happening on the series S also as myself and others i have spoken with are all on the series x. A real shame this is happening as the game was already getting bad reviews outside of the paid for reviews, the customers still buying this game after waiting 10 years since the last Dragon Age are rewarded with repeating the same sections, over and over in the hopes it wont crash this time.
 My advice would be wait before buying this game, not only will the price go down in time (i have already seen it selling for £37 just a few days after i paid £50) but the game will hopefully get updated/patched in time.

Detach from the media storm. Form your own opinion,personally I enjoyed it. It does have some cringe moments in dialogue but far from what you have heard. There are choices for genders and pronouns but as in real life they are optional. There are moments where they play it safe and an angry or evil choice would be great,but again it's hardly worth not playing. It isn't origins no,but what game made now really effects us like games did back when our lives were less complicated.  It isn't perfect and is sometimes in need of some darker tones but it is fun enjoyable escapism that will keep you busy.

Misses the mark
Now that I've finished it, I can say the game is ok. I like a lot of the overarching narrative, but it's undermined by the writing/dialogue that gets you from A to B. Unlike previous BioWare games, there's little freedom to shape your character's personality (dialogue options seem quite similar). The game's lacks the edge and grittiness that could have really boosted it and as a result it feels like it targets a younger audience. Overall, it's an ok game but far from BioWare's peak.

Yes this game is different, yes it's more woke, yes it's far less explicit than previous games and yes I was a little bummed about it. But let me tell you about how the game made me feel. I was engrossed from the character creation, on which I spent a good hour. The different characters and their personalities made me laugh out loud at points because they are brilliant. The decisions I had to make made me nervous, their outcomes made me elated, sometimes sad. By the end of the game I had a bubble of absolute happiness in my chest and tears in my eyes because I genuinely loved the experience of this game and was totally in love with my team and my rook and assan! This game is a worthy chapter in this franchise and deserves more than it's getting from people. Yes I wish some things had been done differently. But it made me feel awesome, I absolutely recommend!!

Much better than expected
- Great visuals and the story is interesting
- Some good lore for long time DA fans
- A good entry point for new fans
- Combat sytstem is surprsing deep and complex
- Some good character development overall
-Highly detailed hub maps that respects the players time
-Game world detailed but not full of bloat
-Side quests feel meaningful
My only con is that some of the writing could be better in places, but that is a very small gripe. 9/10 for me. I hope everyone that plays enjoys the game!

Better than Inquisition but has some flaws
I was sceptical at first, after seeing so many negative reviews, but this game suprised me. The combat is fun, though I miss the three party and more tatical set up of previous games. The characters are mostly likeable, Bellara really grew on me. Biggest issue was Taash, not because of the non-binary stuff (actually thought that was handled quite well). They're just so abrasive! Writing isn't as bad as most claim, some is but the majority is decent. Though not as good as the previous games. No bland search quests is appreciated. Lack of imported choices from previous games is a great shame but the finale is fantastic, best of any DA game with strong ME 2 vibes. Overall I understand the problems some have with the game and agree with a lot of the criticism. Just for me I enjoyed more than didn't, far more than Inquisition. I'll definitely do more playthroughs.

Ignore the haters....
Wasnt sure what to expect when I got this game... I love the series and have completed all of the DA Games multiple times. The critic reviews were good but lots of hate online. Having played the game for a few hours, its clear that the hate is from a small group of bigots or people that expected something different from the game. 
The graphics are stunning, if not a little cartoonish and different from previous DA games, I like the new look though. 
Characters are varied and have depth, however the voice acting for Neve isnt great.
Gameplay is slightly more linear that previous DA games, but by not having to fill big open world areas, they have been able to put more detail into the locations. 
Battles are fun, and engaging, with loads of new skills and abilities to learn. Including abilities that cause status changes in enemies, that can then be triggered by certain attacks from other characters to create new effects. It's slightly more button bashing than previous games but it works.

The story ties up the loose ends in the DA lore with extra twists and unexpected turns. I cried at 1 point ( if you know you know), romances are okish, combat fast and furious. -1⭐ for lukewarm romances, lack of jokes and not enough Spite.
All in all an good play, ignore the haters who are only a few hours in..........it gets epic.

Slow Burn
It takes a while to get going, almost 20 hours before things get spicey. Art style for cutscenes are an odd choice, seeing Dwarves with shiny shimmering beards is just weird. Very linear ala DA2 and combat is hack & slash, which can be quite draining until you start unlocking abilities. LGBQT+ content is not shoved in your face like some people would have you belive.

Not the best DA game but still entertaining
Ignore the gammon dropping 1 star reviews because they are threatened by non binary characters, its good to see representation. The game seems a little slow to start with and has a rather linear path to follow - thanks to the folk who complained about open world in Inquisition 😑. Looks beautiful though, has some good characters too. Enjoying the story 6 hours in, but it does feel like a step in the wrong direction from the last game. Average game with good additions but with entertaining bits taken away.

It's good, you will enjoy it.
I don't always finish all games, I hated Starfield, but I am a big bioware fan and I have played all of their games over the years.  The one consistent thing about DA is that all of the games have been different, unlike ME which had a continuous hero and theme.  So every time  a new DA game has come out, there have been criticisms.  This game in particular for having a non binary character which has triggered all the right wing nut jobs.  If you like bioware, you will like this!

The game is genuinely fun. The combat is satisfying and meaty. Some of the cutscenes are very cinematic, and your custom character looks cool in them. 
All the anti woke nonsense is just a bunch of snowflakes getting angry over something that can be completely ignored because they where told to get angry over it by grifters.

Not really dragon age
The hate given by the anti-LGBT children is unfair. DA has always been inclusive and groundbreaking for this. That said sadly due to the bad writing it's too distracting from the immersion in places, but no more than other questionable story elements (the world is ending so lets go for a stroll and feed the birds)  
In terms of gameplay I have enjoyed the new combat system, but would have much prefered the older style, with the option of switching to play as companions.
The characters and story are quite bad though, with limited RPG story changing elements. I genuinly tuned out for a lot of the banal conversations as I just didn't care about the characters.
Graphically its very pretty....but is that right for this series? 
Overall its playable but quite forgetable and not what I'd hoped for one of my favourite franchises.

Decent to pretty good
Love the combat 8.5/10.... story is intresting 7/10.... writing is solid 7/10... world and graphic i like it 7.5/10... The gender stuff doesnt affect the game just bc there are sliders in the charackter creation or having 1-2 conversation in the game doesnt affect it at all! (cyberpunk 2077 isnt diffrent in this way). And yes i agree it has nothing to do with this stuff in a game like this. U can create hot female if ur not lazy. Charachters romances/ questlines are intresting too 7/10 if ur for the same interest as i do give it a try.  Ignore the false 1 stars rates. I rate this as a not DA series fan even thou i played DA inquisition.
And ofc it has its issue but its by far not as bad how ppl (hater) say.
I did wait 2 days long and looked up reviews and yes i was sceptic but im happy to play it now after i decited to purchase it. The best part if for me is the combat and class system this alone is a reason to play it + having a decent story is the good bonus on top

Start is a slow burn and if you play as evil character your options are limited, but gets lot better futher you get in to the game. Combat is better than in Inquisition and is still leaning more towards flashy action rather than Origins. While world isn't as dynamic as Baldurs Gate 3, the dialogue isn't as bad as some want you to believe and graphics are beautiful, detailed and have some personality.

I have played all the previous games and I'm huge fan of the series. It took a while to get into it but then I was hooked. The main problem I had was getting used to the combat system. Mainly due to the enemies constantly going after my character. Thankfully with practice it got easier. It was a shame very few world state choices made it through but I understand why. On the positive side I enjoyed the story and the companions at times it was cheesy but in true dragon age fashion. Looking at you Alistair with your cheesy romantic lines. I was pleased there was little to no fetch quests they drove me nuts in inquisition. The lore changes may not be popular but work well for me. As with the graphics.

A disrespect to the series lore and your worldstate from previous games (with retcons and scorched earth), minimal moral nuance in (the lack of) choices and story conflict, little roleplay opportunity that hardly qualifies as an RPG (carried by a great character creator), and an ending that is rather unsatisfying.

The graphics are great, the combat is the most enjoyable of the series there is plenty of content as of writing im 93hours in, according to the XB stats, and im still in playthrough 1. This game has its issues sure as all games do The combat cam can be a bit off, the parry indicator doesn't quite match parry window. However, the game has some great features the hair physics are the best i've seen, the transmog system is great, the facial animations are the best bioware has done the character creator is so detailed. Basically don't go in exspecting BG3 or DAO or you'll be disappointed. Solid DA game.

Graphics are very Fable-esque, combat's a throwback to DA2 (not necessarily a bad thing), storyline's not great but has its moments. Romance is virtually non-existent beyond some dialogue and a scene (no that's not a typo) and feels like it's sacrficed for all the gender stuff (though i admit that made Taash's story a bit more interesting for me). It has some replay value but i won't lie, i found it very hard to really care about the new companions. Worth £80? No; wait for a sale or save reward points for a gift card. A pity this is what Dragon Age appears to be ending on but i guess it's what we've got.

Ok. An honest review
Ok so i just completed the game after 105 hours. Theres lots not to love. The combat is pretty basic and quite hack n slash, the enemy variation is minimal, some of the dialogue is abysmal and cringe, the agenda pushin and non-binary backstory  is just unnecessary and adds nothing and its quite PC and far from the dark fantasy feel of its predecessors.........but......and its a big but....THAT FINALE!! The final chapter is incredible, the best ending of the entire series by a country mile. It gives you the action, drama and heartbreak that you expect with bioware and gives it a much needed breath of life. Does it save the game?.....no.....but it makes the overall experience a damn site better

One of the best Dragon Age games!
This is a really solid addition to the series; the story is tight, the overall play has been streamlined, and a lot of bloat has been trimmed. It takes some of the best parts of the previous games whilst also doing something new and interesting, such as the combat, characters and quests, and like previous games, it has lighter, funny moments along with the darker, gritty ones. I especially love the characterisation of Rook. It's a really fun experience all round! 100% a Dragon Age game!

May the dreadwolf take you.
As someone who has finished the game, and every companion quest and faction. This game is so beautifully written, sure there are times where im like really? hah. however the story and plot really makes it feel as if you live in these worlds. Which is a step up from inquisition. The bosses were challenging and the dragons were fun to kill. though i felt it a little disconnected that you could only bring two companions, i found myself not really noticing, i also found myself changing up my party in order to fit well with locations. eg In minrathos id bring Neve and lucanis - one knows the place the other loves killing mages. There are alot of major choices which actually have consequences, unlike its former game. Honestly this game played with my heartstrings alot. Honestly this is a great game, and Bioware have done an excellent job in tying bits of media like the novels and comics, and also the other games to this one. i thoroughly enjoyed this, and will be creating another character!

I think its getting alot of uneeded hate.
I have been playing DA since DAO and i love the franchise the have tried some things people dont like and some people do. For me it answered so many lore questoins and i have enjoyed the story. Sure do i wish it was darker at times yeah but its still got a good level of it. Even characters like Taash after the game reavels something about them i was like god here we go but iended up loving them as a character. Over all no not perfect i expected more for a 11 year wait but a brilliant iwould say give a good chance ive enjoyed it alot

Dragon Age is back!
What a beautiful game! DAV is absolutely amazing. I have played all of the Dragon Age games previous to this one and I am really enjoying this new game. The game leads perfectly into the story from DA:I (Dragon Age Inquisition) but it also allows new players to enjoy the game without playing the other games. That being said playing the other games is worth it as it adds to the experience. The graphics are BEAUTIFUL and stunning to look at and the gameplay is a lot of fun. The character creation is SO detailed and fun, it is easy to get lost in it in a goodway, I spent 4 hours making my rook. BioWare thank you for bringing back the dragon age universe, I can't wait to see more Dragon Age games in the future. This game is absolutely brilliant and beautiful. 😊🙌

Enjoyable return to DA universe. Lots to like particularly Final Act which is as close to ME2 Suicide Mission as we may get. Proud of Bioware's efforts. There are however some poor writing in places that takes it away from the high point of DAO. It is worth your time if you love Dragon age and i'd make a case for it being 2nd best in the series.

My new favorite game
Slight SPOILERS 
I adore this game. I love that I can create a non-binary and trans character, being queer myself, to relate to. I love that my Lavellan got her happy ending. I love that you can help Taash figure out their identity. I LOVE the new style, it just feels so alive. I like the story and wish there was a little more Solas but I forgive that due to the Isabela appearance.
I don't enjoy not knowing recommended levels for quests or when a main story quest will cause me to miss out on an unfinished companion quest. I wish there were specialisations for mages that match their starting faction, not just Mourn Watch, Crows and Shadow Dragons. I wish I could ask companions more questions. I wish there were more romance scenes.
BUT
This game still made me cry in all the best ways, I will now complete it at least 3 more times.

Dragon Age "ish"
Just finished my first playthrough as a human male gray warden mage, honestly loved the new graphics and art thats put into the game, the combat system is different to previous games and i don't mind those changes, the story kept me on my toes you play as a character that has to somehow stop the gods from destroying everything you know, its you vs the gods, good luck. 

SPOILER WARNING
What the game doesn't do right for me is that bioware have decided to be lazy with only 3 decisions you made in DA Inquisition, if you've been playing since Origins, Bioware don't care, your Hero of Ferelden doesn't exist no mension of the Warden in the game even tho if they live or die there's a griffin statue or grave in Weisshaupt to honor them. In Veilguard its not there. Also in Inquisition Hawke/Allistair/Stroud/Logain, end up in Weisshaupt, in Veilguard they're not in the Game.
Conclusion
The game has its Pros/Cons but its more of a target to new users and not die hard fans

Decent
it’s not AS bad as everyone is saying but it’s not amazing either. i’ve seen a lot of people complaining that it’s not like older da games but that should be obvious as different people made the game.. the writing can be a bit cringe at times but for the most part it’s alright. combat was really fun untill about 75 hours in, it did start getting repetitive but since you can change your build whenever you want for free that problems pretty easy to get around. i can’t really see why people are complaining about how ‘woke’ it is. one main character is non - binary and i thought it was written decently again some cringe parts but mostly good. my biggest problem with the game are that we don’t know anything about the main villains other then they’re evil and that’s that. no actual back story and we don’t really learn anything about them or why they’re doing what they’re doing at any point in the game which was quite disappointing. Overall i enjoyed it and will probably replay it.

Decent game overall, but far too disney pixar
Gave a 4 as the game itself is good, the worlds are done well and the main plot is ok, However. It's DA supposed to be dark fantasy and the art direction has gone far to disney pixar even the qunari for instance look human with perfect skin, i get the dark spawn are different for story reasons but zero blood mauled bodies in a dark fantasy? Basically tuned it down for 10 yr olds. The writing is ok 60% of the time but the everbody gets a trophy happy perfect wokeness that has been forced into it literally adds nothing it just takes away from the overall game.

So about 5 hours in. Seems good, the narrative and cinematics are well done. Combat fun and while the strategy of older dragon age lost after BG3 it would pale if they went that way. Visuals and art design great. My main gripe is it is too linear path with little openess. I mean it is more focused and that is a lot better than an empty open world of filler.hope it opens up a little more with secrets.

I amongst many fans who had been playing dragon age since 2009 was sceptical about this one but boy was I wrong, the story, the characters that you grow to love worry for their survival in a Mass Effect 2 suicide mission style ending. The combat was amazing and free flowing but it wasn't the prettiest one to look at nor was the dialogue at times but i now understand the 9/10 ratings and I myself can give it a 9/10.

It's good but- [excuse the short summary/word limit]
I have played all of the dragon age games- and grew up with the series
I feel complicated about this game, online there has been a mass wave of haterd, some valid points, some not- I've seen a lot of misinfomation especially regarding the game's endings and guides, 
I believe feedback is important but  a lot of people who are talking about the game have used it as an excuse to be cruel or spread anti lgbt+ messages.
So heres my thoughts if your interested in the game¦
The dialog has okay/emotional moments but lines are sometimes delivered poorly  the writing throws in a lot of modern day slag that can break immersion, out of place/awkward
Companions are very loveable and have their own unique quest
Hardest thing for me as a fan is the choices, unlike previous games- no data is carried over, leaving the series final goodbye as a punch to the gut- I don't get to see the outcome of all those stories i helped build, gameplay/customization is amazing, doesn't feel like DA games,

Long time series fan since Origins. This game isn't that, but its fun and worth a play. Just go into it with your eyes open. Combat is engaging and the story really picks up after around 20 hours or so. This is clearly targeted at engaging new players with lore tending to be buried in the codex. Had I hoped for more? Yes. But maybe if we're lucky this will do well enough that we get another. I'd recommend it - its better than ME Andromeda by far.

Played 5 hours. Combat is very good so far. RB brings your powers up and also your companions, easy to use. The audio is excellent as well with swelling music and crisp loud battle sounds. The story so far is easy enough and engaging enough for me to still be invested in it. I agree with reviews saying the companions being tame but i think thats balanced out with more horror elements in monster design and some dark story situations. The darkspawn have never looked so good. Some proper weirdos are upset and scared at alleged wokeness in game, ignore it cos game seems to be a hit.

Could have been epic, didn't quite meet expectations
As a huge fan of the other games, I felt the concept battle for thedas was not achieved. They could have included some old favourites for the fans. Saving grace was Solas being a great character. I think romances need to be designed by someone who has more imagination. If id not played other games this would have scored better as visually it is epic and battling was good. Bioware need to remember who the fans and buyers of the games were. 6\10

This is a good game! Don’t listen to review bombers.
First off: this is more an action game akin to God of War than the more RPG heavy previous games in the franchise. But give it a chance and you’ll find it’s a satisfying end to the Dragon Age story! This is still a quality action RPG, with great characters and epic moments. It’s clearly a labour of love for Bioware. I understand some people might be disappointed about the change in gameplay towards an action RPG. But I don’t understand hating on a Dragon Age because it has diverse characters - that’s what the series has always been about! Give this game a chance and you’ll find there’s a lot to love here - just make sure to do all the Crossroads stuff for the best ending!

Return to Thedas
More focused than its predecessor, and sporting a new art style that some may find divisive, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a welcome return to Thedas. Combat is better than ever, having commited to choosing a fully action-oriented approach as opposed to the hybrid action-tactical system used in Inquisition, and the story's intriguing set-up promises another memorable tale filled with interesting characters old and new. Here's hoping it doesn't take another decade for a follow-up, though!

I honestly don't understand the hate. It's different from the previous DA games but it doesn't mean it's worse. If you don't like the smooth graphics just turn off the bloom. I personally really enjoy it. Combat is fun and dynamic. Characters are intresting, story is good, especially the companion's quests, voice acting and locations are great. I almost missed it because of the negative reviews. Try it and have fun!

Actually good
Give it a chance, every new entry to a franchise is met with hate, but if they made it like previous versions there would only be complaints they need to move on and change it up, so far i'm really enjoying the game, love the characters,the leveling system and the setting, give it some of your time

Give it time. Took me a bit to start getting into it. Struggled to find the right hair for my Rook 😅 took me longer to like my characters appearance, but I'm finally happy with it... for now.

Worth playing, ignore the haters!
As a beloved player to the previous dragon age games, i really enjoyed it. Sure there are certain elements which may have just missed the mark a tad, but the story, the gameplay,the interactions with companions and the visuals of this game had me hooked until the end. Iwould definitely recommend to any fellow dragon age lovers!

Its alright
I mean dont get me wrong the graphics and areas look amazing, the combat is decent (somtimes feels repetitive) and its an ok game, my only downside is the companions it just feels like some are good but some others just annoy me, the missions start to feel repetitive and your dialogue feels nothing like a main character should be at times

GAME OF THE YEAR!!!
In my 20 year's of gaming this is the first time I have decides to leave a review. I think in a time where it seems popular to slam every game for any reason the deva just don't deserve it here. The gameplay is fluid and fun, the story is captivating, the world is beautiful and I feel fully immersed, yes it is a little different to previous entries but I think I am learning to ignore reviews and try it for yourself. After initial hesitation to play I gave it a go and it is amazing.

Good overall so far... But.
I'm enjoying it so far, the only thing wrong so far is that my character has really long hair and it keeps clipping through their body and neck, hopefully an easy fix, but apart from that it's all great.

The PC Player Paradox
PC players are often the first to complain, nitpicking every detail of a new release, while console players are generally happy to dive in and enjoy games as they are. Rather than emracing the fun, many PC players focus on minor negatives, often just echoing others' opinion creating a wave of unnecessary criticism. 
It's ironic that the group most vocal about games is also the least satisfied, and it's about time PC players let others enjoy gaming without the constant critiques. They're like spoilt children. I'm loving the game. Make your own decision

Wonderful game.
Lot of 1 star reviews showing on xbox store, but the average rating shows a better picture and currently 54% of players giving it 5 stars. Great immersive fun. Highly recommended. Well thought out, engaging and well paced combat. Good story and characters. Let the haters hate, but for me, this is the best in the series.

A new imaginate version of the series, there was not as much tension berween companions as in previous game but i really enjoyed the more fluid approach to combat and there were some absolutely epic cut scenes. A different Dragon age for sure, although it has been a wild and entertaining blast!

Different Dragon, good nonetheless
This installment is more of an action RPG, the overall systems are slimmed down across the game but the combat is so so much better than any of the previous games.   You can dodge and parry etc making it more enticing and enjoyable. 

There is less companions and even thou their stories etc are quite rigid they are good and original to some extent. 

The game overall doesn't have as much depth as inquisition but the story is a lot better and the last section of the game is bioware at its best.

Superb Game
Some say this isn't Dragon Age, which I find a little bewildering. It is most definitely Dragon Age. I've played all the Dragon Age games, I loved them all. It's no secret that there were issues during the development of this game, but what the devs have created is amazing. I love the whole series, but this has become my favourite. Don't listen to all the negativity, this game is brilliant. A lot of devs lost their jobs because of the negative reviews and low sales, this was totally unjustified. It does lean more towards an action rpg, but it no less deep. If you love rpg's, don't miss out on this, it really is brilliant.

Enjoyable fun
Just finished and really enjoyed it.
A lot of the darkness of origins has been smoothed away and all the characters are too nice, but, i thought it respected my time, i found inquisition far too bloated with meaningless busywork but this was a lot better paced.
If they can just add back some more meaningful dialogue options like origins,it would be even better.
Probably my second favourite dragon age after origins.
Dragonage 2 the repetitive environments got so annoying I stopped before finishing.
Inquisition was far too bloated and felt like the collectibles were just there to waste your time.

After being underwhelmed by the ending battle with Corephyus in DAI (ending being phenomenal) the bosses here realllly make up for it.
The game is very different to the original trio but combat wise and graphics wise its amazing to see DA played this way.

Fun combat, STUNNING art direction (robbed at GOTY for that, at least) and compelling characters, as a longtime DA fan, I am pleased with this as a sequel. Yes, it's disappointing that all our previous worldbuilding is irrelevant (at best 🥲) and I do miss Trevor Morris's score, but this isn't a 'bad' game at all!

The characters and scenery is absolutely gorgeous, the companions personalities all shine as individuals and the story lines are well written! Absolutely loving having new dragon age lore with old and new characters its literally the same as the other games only difference now is chuds have all been brainwashed into thinking about genitals ALL THE TIME its actually creepy boys...
