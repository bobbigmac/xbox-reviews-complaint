So I'm reasonably early days into this game, but I gotta say it's a blast. Genre-wise it's a smash bag between skating, cooking, fighting games, and narrative choice. Which sounds like it shouldn't really work? But...it does. The game embraces theatrical-realism right out of the gate, and it makes all of the rest of it just *flow*. Everything is both real, and a silly metaphor: You read a magazine quiz? It's a psycho-sexual examination of your preferences (while also skating). You pet a dog? You get a 30 second long QTE to do a secret handshake with the dog. And that's the first 5 minutes of the game (not kidding btw).

I will say if you dislike QTE (quick time events) then this game is possibly not for you, because it has a lot of them. Fortunately it's not a case of 'do the QTE or die', it's more a case of mastery and bonuses. Time the rhythms and QTEs, do more damage, that kind of thing. So I quite enjoy it, which is rare for QTEs!

It's also just a hell of a lot of fun to play a game about a protagonist that, well, isn't anything like me! Getting slammed into someone else's life, culture, internal-understanding, it immediately makes for an interesting experience.

And importantly, it's all really well written. It walks the line where you kinda hate Jala (the protagonist), but you also get it? Other people are also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you get why they are too. And mixing in the over the top drama of quasi-real sexy-insult fighting as a blunt metaphor for your relationship with other people is...well...actually pretty close to how that often feels! The quips, the negative self talk, the obvious ♥♥♥♥ ups, it's often funny at the same time as it hurts. Which, yeah, that's just real good writing.

Also the music ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whips. It's just great.

Basically if you're willing to give something bright and colourful and enjoyably fun/peculiar, I absolutely recommend.

OH ALSO it's really horny. The name of the game should have tipped you off to that, right. But yeah, you can be a thirsty mess for all these messy people. So if you want to be hornt up, then go get it!

It's a drama about a queer immigrant (and disaster of a woman) trying to take ownership of her past mistakes, while struggling to handle her families expectations of her.
That plays out via Yakuza style absurdity, where even simple things like petting a dog are transformed into a multi-step qte where you do an elaborate secret handshake with the dog, and the dog can kickflip a skateboard.

Absolutely recommend. Great story, entertaining and sometimes hilarious presentation, great music.

This was like Scott Pilgrim with more self awareness. I'm quite a fan of how this was handled, not to mention it gave me a better perspective on life itself. I will say, it sucks that you lose MP even when you whiff an attack, but other than that, I really don't have any major complaints. Also I can say that certain plot threads in the end game go unresolved. If you're looking for an off the beaten path RPG in the indie scene, check this out.

I have recently beaten the third main boss and figured now would be a good time to give my first impressions.

Story: If you enjoy middle and high school drama, then I think you'll enjoy the story. From what I can tell, it's basically about a girl, Jala, going back to her hometown after leaving it 3 years ago and trying to make amends to all of her former friends and ex's. I don't know how it's going to go in the end as I've only beaten the third boss, but so far it doesn't seem that bad. The dialogue is funny, the voice acting is actually pretty good, and the overall story isn't super cringe-worthy compared to other similar games. It's something that you could actually picture happening in real life.

Gameplay: Call me pleasantly surprised. The combat is turn-based but with a unique twist with taunts and skills that do more damage based on taunts. The animation is good, the combat dialogue is witty and some of it made me chuckle, and the fights are actually pretty challenging. I am playing on hard mode and there have been a few fights where I really had to stop and think about what my next move should be, which is a good thing to have.

Of course, if you're not the type of person to enjoy a lot of challenge or you just want to play for the story, then there are multiple difficulty settings for you to choose.

Also, there's a lot of QTEs. Basically the entire game is QTEs, even the combat and mini-games. Think of South Park: The Stick of Truth, or Yakuza 7: Like a Dragon. During combat, you need to time the QTEs for extra damage and defense.

Luckily for anybody who has trouble with QTEs, there's accessibility options where the game will time it for you. Great for anybody who can't or don't care to do it.

Aesthetic: I love the graphics and art style. It looks very cozy yet energetic.

Message: This game is very queer, and it makes no attempts to hide that. You play as a bisexual girl, your main ex is a MtF transexual, and there's lots of messages about struggles that queer and discriminated people face. It's very blunt about it.

But compared to some other games that try to promote a similar message, this game does a good job of doing so while not being cringy or oddly pushy about it and also keeping the gameplay engaging. I especially love the dialogue between Jala and her family. The dialogue is well-crafted and designed so it feels like something that totally could happen in real life. And I'm sure some people have experienced or at least heard of some people going through the same struggles.

Overall: The game is very good. I came in here with pretty low expectations and was pleasantly surprised to find an actually decent story and good gameplay.

Is it worth the $30? I'm not sure yet. That's going to depend on how long the game is. Currently I'm at 4.4 hours and it feels like I'm half-way done but I could be wrong. I hope I'm wrong. It'd be a shame for this game to end so early.

Ultimately though if you like the message the game promotes, the high-school drama story, and the turn-based gameplay, I think you'll find yourself enjoying it.

Edit:
I have now completed the game and gotten all of the achievements.

The ending went much better than I expected, with lots of feelings to be had. I'll let you find out what happens at the end.

The game is fairly short with only 10 hours to 100% the game. The most tedious achievement was winning 50 battles. It just took a while, not really difficult. The skating challenges were actually pretty fun, I enjoyed it the more I got better at it.

Ultimately is this game worth $30? I would give it a yes. It's a little on the short side but the production value was quite high for a small company. Playing through this game, seeing all the quirky animations, the heart-felt messages, and the overall theme of "be who you really are and don't let other people decide for you", you could really feel the heart and soul put into it. It really felt like a labor of love.

It's short but it's sweet. If you're interested in the game at all I would say it's worth it, especially if you can get it on sale.

Thanks for the devs for making a memorable game. It is very unique, even by indie game standards.

I initially gave this game a positive review, but it pains me to say, the gameplay is not good.
The story, dialogue, art, music, interactions you can have with some objects (like the dog petting QTE) and boss battle are all top tier.

BUT, the skating is clunky and feels unresponsive, that mixed with very tight time limits makes getting S rank on challenges a grindey nightmare where I have to learn VERY precise timings and directionals otherwise the character overshoots or undershoots. It wouldn't be much of a problem if cosmetics weren't locked behind S tier, so it's perfection or nothing, so when you finally end up getting them it doesn't feel like an accomplishment, it just feel like luck when the controls finally listened to you. The skating really feels like something you'd get in early access/beta, not in a released product.

The combat is also pretty bad outside of boss battles, the boss battles are interesting because you get character interactions, but anything else is annoying because it's really slow and way too easy. Turn based RPGs are usually pretty grindey, but it's not much of a problem when you can quickly pass trough your abilities. But because the combat is based around quick time events it ends up being really slow. The status effects are interesting in concept, but because the rest is a slog, hearing the same voice lines and stiff animations gets annoying.

Overall it's an amazing story with fun and quirky bosses padded out by unpolished gameplay. Which pains me because I can neither recommend this game to my friends who like RPGs because the combat isn't good nor friends who like stories because the game mechanics would get in their way.

If you watched the trailer for this game or look at the screen shots and think you will enjoy the game, you will. The game sells itself to you upon first glance.
If you are queer, from a minority household, or have had messy relationships in the past this game is for you.
I highly recommend this game to you dear reader.

I don't think there are a lot of games that try to handle the nuances of failed relationship and self destructive habits as well as this one. It's hard, it's heavy, it's never the same as it once was. The message of the story is as good as the delivery. This game is fun, and it doesn't want to be anything more than that, but you there's still writing weighs with you all throughout, but you'll only feel lighter when it's over

Everything Thirsty Suitors tries—whether it be the humor, creating engaging storylines, or switching genres between turn-based RPG, cooking, and skating—it succeeds in greatly. Lovable characters, a charming story, and the relatable generational trauma of second-generation immigrants come together to make a game that just works, and works exceptionally well. As a Sri Lankan, never did I think I'd see the day where I'd be playing as a Sri Lankan protagonist, cooking Sri Lankan dishes, and fighting off the expectations of South Asian parents. Thirsty Suitors is one of my top games of 2023, and I'd highly recommend it!

Great exploration of the intersecting identities of queerness and South Asian culture, through the eyes of a daughter of immigrants. The narrative involves great character growth and a refreshingly flawed protagonist. I deeply enjoyed the mechanic of resolving differences through turn-based combat, with beautiful animation and creative storytelling.

Some of the more generic combat encounters got a bit repetitive (while delivering a lot of amusement the first few times) and this game involves a lot of quick-time events, so up to you if that is something you enjoy. I thought the cooking mini-game was both educational, fun, (and made me so hungry!), and the skating mechanic was very satisfying. This game features such a colorful cast of characters that made narrative exploration exciting and captivating. I so hope to see more games like this one!

Story is a sort of Scott Pilgrim vs the World paired with Everything Everywhere All At Once.
Gameplay is persona paired with tony hawk and quicktime events.
Not sure how that works, but it's ridiculously fun.

Might be good for some type of players, but for me, I tried to stick with it, and couldn’t do it anymore. I wasn’t super invested in the character’s story arch. Credit where credit is due, it does have a good variety of mini games. I also applaud for them trying to create something different. I’ve clicked ‘not recommended’ from a personal perspective as I don’t think it’s good value for money - trying too many things at once, and didn’t hit the mark for me. But, lots of positive reviews saying otherwise. Maybe a quick YouTube first before purchasing so you can figure out what side of the fence you’ll sit on.

Man, what a perfect game. And yes, I support LBGTQ+. But I am a cis-white male, and this game was immensely relatable. I feel this should be the gold standard for writing queer/diverse cast. This felt like TRUE representation, I simultaniously was exposed to a beautiful American-Indian cultured household, AND was able to relate to the characters in almost EVERY way. I, too, was a twenty something drop out, I, too, failed all my early relationships in emotionally scarring ways, and had to face several of them when I got therapy! These felt like REAL people with REAL problems. It was beautiful. I got emotional and cried at the end. The reason this should be the standard for representation is that is shows we aren't that different from one another, white, black, trans, gay, indian, martian, whatever. We all live, and fail, and love. Thanks devs. Best gaming experience I have had in some time. Thanks Annapurna for funding another classic.

This game deserves a lot more recognition than it is getting. It is exactly what so many people who i have talked to about the Persona series want, more mature themes and relationships, a setting out of high school, more deep and dynamic relationships, more nuances in the main character rather than just a perfect protag that everybody loves. I mean, everyone loves Jala, but she is a hot mess, but thats what makes it interesting. I have been in love with so many toxic people in my life and have also been toxic as ♥♥♥♥ for years of my early twenties, just like Jala and hurt people i cared about.

I know a lot of people say this game is like Persona meets Tony Hawk, but it also reminds me a lot of Night in the Woods. A coming home story about finding and facing yourself. It has a great female protaganist, and both are kinda lovable idiots. You have a great family cast, and great cast of exes, excellent voice acting.

AND SO MUCH love went into this game. I know a lot of people say that about every indie game, but so few indie games have the thoughtfulness that this games writing has. The little discussions your family has as you do the cooking mini game, to the all the dialogue Jala can have for each enemy; FOR EACH MOVE for each enemy. Usually when I play an JRPG, within the first ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hour, I have already heard the NPC's repeat their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ taglines over and over again, but Jala has so many quips and lines and quotes and puns for each taunt that i think i have only ever heard like one repeated once. Theres even a different line of Dialog from your dad every time you lose a fight depending on who you lost the fight too. it just feels so well crafted, so thoughtful, that it really stands above indie and into the realm of AA games.

I have played A LOT of indie games, its been my sole focus choice of games for about 8 years. And there are tons I love, but there also tons that have weak writing. One I played 8 years ago that I thought had really good writing at the time but upon returning too (VA-11 Hall-A: Cyberpunk Bartending) actually is soooo flat in its writing and nuances, it really reflected just how flavorful and different each character is from one another in this game.

It has great pacing, each event flowing well into the next with no grinding, great music, great combat akin to Paper Mario where each move requires an interactive quick time event, incredibly stylish moves and the way you get around the game is by skateboarding Tony Hawk style.

Just to give a small taste of the level of love the devs poured into this game. There's a part in the game where you can unlock the dog in the freeskate area, and the devs designed EVERY SINGE move to look completely different and just as equally stylish and bombastic when you are using the dog. This is such a small touch a lot of people might just completely miss but they did it cuz ♥♥♥♥ it why not.

best indie game I've played since Potionomics, might even top it to be honest.

Thirsty Suitors is a difficult game to write a review for - it was at times enjoyable, at times frustrating.

Pros
- I enjoyed the variety of characters you get to interact with, and just enough time to get to know them in what's otherwise not a long game. There's no one I dislike, and some (like Auntie C!) always brought a smile to my face.
- I liked cooking the dishes - their parallels to combat means it was good practise for action commands, and the dish items you make are quite useful. I love a game that makes me hungry with in-game food.
- Its over-the-top style is really fun, there's enough clothing customisation to make things your own, and skating around the city was enjoyable.

Cons
- The game design consistently felt off. I played on the suggested 3* difficulty, which was punishing at first. But once you get the hang of the action commands, it feels like there wasn't enough else going on? The status ailments are interesting in theory, but you can only do the ones they're weak to (and often have to cycle through all of their weaknesses to finish the battle, anyway). You end up getting 5 versions of each move (weak/strong/group attacks in all types). I struggled finding a gear setup I liked and felt relevant, I wasn't sure what my thirst-sona did outside of stats.
- I can't say I love the premise of the game. I know I'm playing as Jala, not myself, but I never really liked any of the choices I was presented with (often: snap back, deflect, or apologise yet again) - I know that's the point, but it made me feel like when reconciliation happens, it comes out of nowhere. That also contributed to each ex loop feeling repetitive, like they're other stops in the "apology tour" (though as I said, I did enjoy the exes as characters!) ...I do think the demo and store page are clear about the kind of game it is. I was just hoping I would "feel" the change/intentions of Jala along the way.
- Given my thoughts on the premise, it's not surprising that I wasn't excited by the way the game wrapped up - it felt abrupt. WARNING - Ending spoilers ahead:  It can be read as aspirational, though maybe I would have like it more if there were queer storylines between "I got kicked out we don't speak anymore" and "family will always love you and if you all try it works out" ...I guess once more, I want time with Auntie C, since her story seemed more interesting.

I would still overall recommend playing Thirsty Suitors, if you're ok with the game balance being a little off, and the "apology tour" premise of the story.

I played through the whole game, and I really enjoyed it!

Thoughts:
- Absolutely loved the writing
- Sense of humor appealed to me
- Animations were consistently super entertaining and hilariously delightful
- Enjoyed skating as a means of traversal, though personally didn't enjoy the tricks mechanics (which are generously optional)
- Very cool character design
- Grateful for the accessibility options for QTEs (one gesture was a bit hard for me on my Steam Deck but not an issue with the settings thankfully)
- Totally adored Auntie Chandra

I would definitely recommend this game to others, especially those looking for a good narrative experience.

Look, this is not the most straightforward recommendation. It's more than a little janky, trying to do so much in a small space. But you know what?

I love this game. Despite wishing it had more time, more space to breathe and bake, I love the characters, I love the town, I love the ambition. Nothing else quite does what this game tries to do. Make amends, grow up, help people move on, and cook some amazing parathas.

Please get this game. Get this queer, loving, radical, fun game and pray we see more like it some day.

I got this game on a lark. Dating sims aren't really my thing but I had heard good things. And wow, I'm absolutely blown away by how much I like this game. The characters are all so fun and interesting. Each of them is very layered, even Sergio who I thought was a jerk in the beginning.

And I'm stuck doing all the cooking side quests because I want to spend all this time learning about her parents. Her dad is my favorite but her mom is awesome as well. Can't wait to meet Paati.

I have conflicting feelings about the game.

Not the story; that was great. The plot and the characters had all the humor and fun I had been hoping for when I first wishlisted this game, but I also have a nagging feeling it was supposed to be bigger.

From the prelude before the final boss fight, I feel like the skateboarding had originally been intended as a more integral component but got cut down to two areas and an acid dream sequence. Some of the character arcs are also pretty abrupt, and it's really hard to tell what impact your choices - if any - have on the characters or the story without a second play through, especially when all the relationships are left positive but pretty open-ended by the end of my first go around.

There's a bunch of side quests to earn the exes' friendship again, but it doesn't seem to amount to much. I was kind of hoping for something like Persona, like resolving all your drama and mending all your relationships have them join you as a party for the final boss, or gives you super buffs or something.

But I still love the characters, the writing, the skateboarding, the dancing and cooking minigames, all of it - I just wish there had been MORE of it all. The fact I want more of this is a testament to how impactful the entertainment value was. They're funny, adorable, and it all comes together in a way that kept me playing all the way to the end and having these nagging feelings for more of it.

TL;DR Really good ideas, great soundtrack, Storytelling is lacking and the ending leaves more questions than answers. If you like the anime Food wars or really wanna learn about young adult cultural struggles and figuring our your sexual identity, give it a go.

Usually I don't really leave reviews for games but for this one, I will. I beat the game in just shy of 10 hours playtime and in it's current state I feel it hard to recommend it.
Let's talk positives first
- Artstyle: Probably one of the first things you see about this game, and for good reason: the art is vibrant, the colour pallete and animations are flashy. I enjoyed this aspect of the game a lot.
- Setting and Family drama: The setting is super interesting and I especially enjoyed the tension and relationship with Jala and her Family.
- Mini games: There are multiple mini games in this game, this includes Cooking, dancing and some other mini games. They are mostly fun and the dialogue between the characters in the mini games is witty.
-Soundtrack and SFX. Man what a bop, I was jamming to the music while skating for a good while.
- The Turn-based combat. The main reason i picked this game up was the combat, as it seemed a pretty refreshing take on the turn based RPG genre, which it was.

Now for the negatives:
- The turn-based combat. Yes, I just praised it in the positives, but the combat got really stale, really fast. It's the same quick time events for every move. They repeat a lot. There is never a real threat in combat and some of the combat is just a "I hope you have enough healing items to survive" test.
- Storytelling, specifically the characters. The game throws you into the story as if you have missed something in the beginning, only to then not explain what Jala has actually done wrong. The connection here is missing. Then the problem arises that, despite us as the player not knowing what Jala has actually done wrong, everyone (except Auntie C) absolutely despises us. None of the actual suitors/ exes are actually likeable characters. You try to "fix" your relationship throughout the game with them, but honestly most of them are just rude and I didn't want to make up with them.
- Skateboarding. This is not Tony Hawk and I am thankful that the skateboarding challenges are optional. The skateboarding is clunky at best and unplayable at worst. Jala snaps to locations even though you want to talk to the NPC in front of you, but oh well I guess you are rail grinding now.
- Bugs. Even though there weren't many, especially towards the end I had textures not load in properly, resulting in character models having no eyes or being just straight up textureless.
- The ending

I didn't have expectations going into this one but I came out simply adoring it. What a wonderful mix of family drama, culture and classic turn-based RPG - I was glued to my Steam Deck ever since I began. Full of wonderful representation too.

One of your main antagonists is a man wearing a bear costume who lives in the sewer and leads a cult who have taken over a cryptid-themed skate park. He gives you skating challenges and makes you have cathartic fist fights with children.

For this reason and so many others, this deserves to be rated 'Overwhelmingly Positive'

This has become one of my favorite games. It's so gosh darn charming, I was constantly grinning and laughing as I played. It's quite an interesting combination of an RPG, skateboarding game, and even has cooking thrown in for extra fun. All the over animated actions of the characters adds to the fun, it's truly a treat to look at. Don't think I can recommend it enough.

Persona + Tony Hawk + Thor Ragnarok writing + Hindi undertail music

10/10 game I'd just lower the difficulty since it tends to spend a bit too much time in combate relying on items

A visual novel with light take turn combat centered around ex relationships and family drama. Surprisingly entertaining and with a very good soundtrack. Doesn't overextend its run time either. An overlooked gem of Indie Gaming

A beautiful, chaotic, aesthetic, comical, intense, heartbreaking and heartwarming ride along a complex story of mutual understanding and reconciliations, hurt and care. I loved how so many complex themes have been treated in a nuanced way, never getting heavy-handed but always treated with humor and honesty.

Many of the topics treated I could directly relate to because of who I am or who I have around me, while others were far away from my experience, but the way the story was narrated made me feel everything so deeply, and made me care for every character, listening to their turmoils and hoping for their resolution.

The way lots of different mechanics and genres are mixed together is beautiful, both because it works from the mere point of view of the entertainment it offers, but also because their style and functions interlace so well with the overall experience of the game.

There's a lot to say about this game, about how it often doesn't bring you the kind of resolutions you expect it to, how the characters are presented, and how damn hard some of those skate circuits are, damn you Soundie! But these are all things that are best appreciated by playing it. Have fun and cry and smile like I did. The only thing you will regret is that you wish you could pass more time in Timber Hills and in the psychedelic mindscapes of your exes!

It's hard to believe that a light RPG/dating sim/skateboarding/cooking game could have some of the best-written characters and most emotionally honest dialogue in the current gaming landscape, but Thirsty Suitors pulls it off. It offers the chance to explore a Scott Pilgrim-esque Evil Exes story with much more nuance and depth, and in the end love doesn't necessarily conquer all (and that's a good thing!)
The gameplay often serves as a vehicle for the storytelling in a way that may dissatisfy game purists, but anyone who actually enjoys experiencing a narrative will be in for a treat. I particularly liked the way the boss battles served as metaphors for the exchanges actually occurring between the characters in the real world.
There's so much going on in Thirsty Suitors that it can be forgiven for not having the most robust or deep gameplay in any of its given styles. Try cooking in a Paper Mario game, or healing broken relationships in a Tony Hawk game!
I will say that the setting is a little odd, in that it ostensibly takes place in the late 1990s but feels more like an alternate 2020s where mp3 players, smartphones, and social media were never invented. Teens still spend all their time on their phones, but they're playing Snake and texting with T9Word. It's actually quite charming!

The skateboard part of the game isn't amazing, but the turn-based combat, cooking, writing, voice acting, and presentation as a whole all make this a truly great experience. The dad character is almost worth the price of admission on his own.

I really loved this game! I did find some of the skateboarding challenges to be a bit frustrating, and some of them to be just downright impossible for me to do mechanically. But yeah, I really liked the story and I loved how the game shares with us a culture that is seldom represented in video games, let alone western media.

Quite an incredible game.
Had a blast doing tricks on the skateboard and switching characters as the story progressed.
The story is very well written and it's easy to relate to. Really loved how Jala is her own person, whether the player likes it or not. The visuals were great too, particularly on the boss battles.
What I enjoyed the most was the absurdity of it all. I don't see games that allow you to summon your own mother as an attack very often. I would have loved to meet Uncle Hinti in person, but the rest of the game was excellent, so yeah, go play it.

This sure is two games stapled together! The RPG is delightfully over the top, with some of the best animation and timed action gameplay I've seen in a long while. Skating around town gives a nice feel to getting around, always dropping in tricks as you're on the way to grab a milkshake or confront your next ex.
If I had a complaint, it would be that the difficulty scaling only affects damage and HP/WP costs, as opposed to the attack inputs themselves - I was looking forward to some wild attack challenges but they never really came up, saving the late-game elements for the skating side instead. But always complicated difficulty concerns aside, this is a truly charming game with some of the sharpest familial writing you'll see.

Thirsty Suitors is possibly the most unique, innovative game I've ever played, and I mean that in the best possible sense of that description.

The one tricky thing about it is that it's so good, and yet so absolutely difficult to describe to other people in a way that doesn't prompt a response of "what the actual hell are you talking about?"

It just nails every aspect of what it tries to do - from the writing, to the dance battles to the smooth, fun skateboarding experience. It's so fun, and so queer, and I admire the hell out of the developers for not only trying to seek representation for stories not usually heard in gaming but really setting out to do it in just the most unique way they could possibly imagine.

It's a bit unfortunate it launched at the exact time it did, with a number of AAA releases popular with a lot of the sorts of players likely to like this game (I literally found the game via a review entitled "2023's second-best RPG about people who are too horny for their own good was Thirsty Suitors", referring of course to Baldurs Gate 3) - but it really deserves far, far more hype and attention than it's gotten.

So far, best game I've played this year. It's so fun and daft (in the best possible way) but also manages to be really heartfelt and sweet. Amazing cast, great queer representation, fully fleshed characters (I loved every single one of them). Loved the cooking bits. Go in blind!

YES. it's bright and sharp and funny and lovely. i love jala. please skateboard on my neck.

the game has tons of options for tuning your experience and accessibility and approachability, which is great because i don't want to be an active skateboarder but i want to do everything else. the minigames are relentless. great writing, no surprise with the luminous meghna jayanth on the team. yes yes check it out.

I really enjoyed this game. The writing, characters, and cooking stole the show and kept me very captivated. The combat was competent, if not a bit too simplistic but it was fine.

PS, don't make the same mistake I made for trying to get S rank on every skate challenge. It doesn't get you anything, no achievement, no reward, nothing. Most of the challenges were fine, but there were a few that were very frustrating because the "magnetic" pathing of you attaching to the next obstacle really didn't work well sometimes which led to many fails that I really feel weren't my fault. Most of the more difficult challenges I feel were mostly difficult because of jank, not due to a lack of skill. Overall I'd recommend if a skate challenge is a bit frustrating, just skip it - it's not worth trying to push through.

Thirsty Suitors is one of the best examples of what video games are really capable of in terms of storytelling that no other medium can match. It has incredible writing, a flawless soundtrack, the visuals are gorgeous, and the voice actors do some incredible work in conveying the wide and complicated spectrum of emotions this game portrays. But beyond that, this game leverages gameplay as a storytelling device in a way very few games, much less turn-based ones have done before.

Fights aren't just fights for the sake of fights, the cooking mini-game delivers story and acts as a device for the Jala and her parents to speak more plainly than they would without the medium of cooking. This story couldn't be told any other way and that makes this game incredibly unique.

On top of that the game runs perfectly on release, the accessibility settings are robust and make this game widely accessible even if you don't like aspects of its core gameplay.

I don't really have anything bad to say about this game. It's flawless, incredibly well thought out, and the story it tells is relatable, important, and well written. This is a 10/10 for me. Everybody should play it.

Stylish, fantastically horny, great characters, and a really neat mix of genres: free-form skating, cooking minigames, turn-based battles with your exes that are dramatic and surreal storytelling moments too. The game is full of wit, charm, stinging social commentary, and is dripping in South Asian style, culture, and music, filtered through nineties Americana - just really fresh and original.

It's chill to play, and the minigame reaction timing feels generous - there's a challenge, but it's never insurmountable (and difficulty can be customised too). I’m interested to see where the story goes and play it to the end.

Also I felt so seen by Irfan (and his cat! - the game is hilarious in general, but that boss fight had me laughing out loud) - I think I've been on a similar journey to him. Am still on that journey perhaps...

Recommend playing with a controller!

That feel when no Sri Lankan dad who rhymes your name with a type of fruit.

Fun story, lots of drama that'll feel cathartic for anyone who has abandoned some major things, especially if you're part of some sort of diaspora. Other than the feeling that arcs ended way too soon it was cute and I completely agree with the sentiment of it all. Short and to the point is this game's biggest strength, followed by its visual representation and voice acting, didn't like the music though.

For gameplay itself outside of skateboard challenges I can't recommend it for its turn based battle system. There's something in its status effect focused battle system that could shine and they didn't really capitalise it outside of the final fight (I want more stuff like Ken parrying Chun-Li's attacks as the norm, not the exception), don't be afraid to challenge the player with inputs to keep them engaged because it was exciting to do more than 2! The game would have benefited a lot from a lot of strong challenges (outside of skateboarding) to keep up with its great presentation. Also PLEASE make skateboarding 1.5x faster outside of manuals platforming, I beg of you.

Man, I fell deeply in love with this game! The humor and style is just sooo cool and gave me a lot of inside I didn't have about the Indian-American culture. It is just such a heart warming gaming!

But I gotta say... Some of these skate challenges xD I get that a grind can be fun, but some of them were killing me. But it didn't kill the mood over all and the game kept me always interested with it's story.

Really well done over all and I can't wait comes next from this studio!

While the game has a bit of Persona, a bit of Tony Hawk, a bit of Scott Pilgrim, it packages everything into a fantastic whole. The writing is probably my favorite aspect of the game, you really get to know all the characters, and enjoy the way it escalates into an unforgettable final boss. A very good surprise.

Thirsty Suitors is an abundantly stylish game who's nevertheless unflinchingly raw, emotionally earnest and powerful writing left me in an emotional tailspin. I live streamed my playthrough and it was difficult to say anything at all or to even deflect with a joke because any reaction at all to various plot beats will inevitably say rather a lot about me, more than I really wanted to put out there publicly. It's a strong testament to a game's writing that it's very difficult to engage with, even insincerely or ironically, without leaving a lot of yourself on the table.

I wanted to lead with that positive because that positive does such strong work but Thirsty Suitors has kind of a confusing core loop in that there's both turn based rpg (but it quickly becomes mostly a boss rush there's no real need to engage normal fights past a certain point) but also an entire skateboarding game?? It's not quite on the complexity of a tony hawk pro skater, the focus is more on traversal and it works well enough for what it is, it's not too hard with the notable exception of manuals/wheelies which are incredibly finicky and significantly more difficult to execute than anything else in the game. Still I had more fun with the skateboarding in this than say, Bomb Rush Cyberfunk since Thirsty Suitors actually has the temerity to punish you with loss of combo multiplier if you screw your line up and a need to actually cash your combo out with a finisher, creating escalating tension as you chase bigger number with the risk of beefing it. Wow! risk and reward, what will they think of next.

The two halves don't really mesh but are individually good so it sorta feels like playing two different, albeit very stylish games which I think is liable to frustrate anyone who wanted a pure RPG or indeed a pure skateboarding game. The combat system in the RPG has a lot of good ideas but it never really makes it into a strategically satisfying, complex, whole, it's more the delivery mechanism for various character moments and plot beats in the boss battles but again, that writing is so strong that it makes one willing to forgive a lot. It's always compelling and interesting to see these confrontations play out even if it doesn't make for the most complex RPG ever.

I could go on. Thirsty Suitors is a game that if I wanted to pick fault in, I could? If you're looking for problems, you'll find them. But it's kind of difficult for me to want to when the story it came here to tell is conveyed so well and its sense of style so very captivating, the music in particular, is incredible.

It's absolutely worth playing.

A fun Sri Lankan take on Scott Pilgrim Vs The World! The story and dialogue is fun, and can get emotionally intense in some scenes.
The game is brought down a bit by the gameplay. Fights could have been shortened and the skating gameplay could be tighter. Easy/medium difficulty is the way to go, otherwise it's unnecessarily tedious.
The art style is great, reminiscent of the Spider-verse movies.

Short and sweet! The theme is wonderful and comparable to Persona, but with its own flavour. The animations of everyone making ridiculous acrobatics while doing mundane tasks keeps everything funny and interesting. This game has vision and heart, it must be encouraged and experienced.

The combat was lame, it's the most basic JRPG stuff you can imagine, but with a whole lot of quicktime events. So I recommend leaving the difficulty at the easiest setting to get it over with. There is cooking (only quicktime events) and skating in this game to give you more to chew on if you feel like it

I absolutely loved the game, a cooking, skating and RPG game that all comes together in a funny over the top story/character focused narrative!
The game also has really amazing voice acting to bring life to the really funny interactions and serious bits of the story, that don't wash down with the crazy escalated situations and actions the animation and visual aspect show.
The cast is very diverse and likeable for their rights and more glaringly their wrongs, making some good real characters to love, dislike or connect too, by the way, they love getting relatable in their comedy, sometimes hitting a bit too close to home, but I liked that.
The Gameplay is Good! Cooking is fun, with great dialogue to go with, and Skating is too, mostly becoming the "post-game" in my experience, the RPG part is where most of the story is made, fighting the conflicts away, it's pretty solid and also comes with more great dialogue and character bits. None of the 3 are awesome level of their genre, but work together to build and support a really unique game and story.

TLDR: It's an awesome funny/relatable story driven game with good cooking/skating/RPG elements

The story what really sold this game for me. Had me crying at a couple a points, especially around the family stuff. There certainly are the mash of gaming genres: skating, cooking, quick time events, turn based combat; but I'd more describe this as an anti-dating sim. Anti in the sense that the pc's (Jala) hold her accountable for how she treated all of them in the past. All while weaving really meaningful stories about each character and their individual struggles.

In short, the writing is some of the best I've experienced in video games: face your past, deal with intergenerational family trauma, and work things out with your loved ones (friends, family, and ex's).

Great game, really mixes up the gameplay often enough to keep every activity feeling fun and fresh. Then on top of that the story builds in a way that keeps me wanting to explore every part of world and meet all the characters.

Some things that I didn't expect from just seeing the trailers are the conversation options that give you these personality points, it adds even more to that RPG feel. Also the skate boarding is done really well, all those years of playing Tony Hawk Pro Skater are being put to good use again.

Overall great game, haven't finished it yet but excited to see where the story goes.

Thirsty Suitors is a game that wears its media influences on its sleeve - the base plot is conceptually similar to Scott Pilgrim Takes Off, you've got Tony Hawk-lite as the primary minigame, the combat and general style of the game feels very turn-based Yakuza (particularly the extremely long skill list), there's a rhythm minigame, a light smattering of "choices-matter" type stat building, all thrown into a big melting pot that might not have been turned up high enough. The real appeal of this game, and the gold that it strikes, is in using these influences as a way to dig into and explore the specific cultural touchstones the game's story is built around.

As someone who wasn't born to South Asian parents, the pressures and expectations foisted upon the protagonist in Thirsty Suitors were not relatable in the sense that I knew the experience, but the game's writing does a fantastic job of conveying those feelings to the player, no matter their demographic. The cast is great, and the various character dynamics with the exes and Jala's family members were fun to explore, even if the game's main plot feels split along one too many lines, with the driving force of the plot abruptly shifting halfway through, the original conflict resolved off-screen between chapters. There is, admittedly, plenty of shakiness throughout both the narrative and the gameplay - the minigames are barebones, the stat building felt like it didn't affect anything, you settle into a rhythm with the combat right away and don't really need to deviate from it, and even though the game does take place over the span of a couple days, the pacing felt very herky-jerky, advancing rapidly in some chapters and dragging along in others.

Even with those drawbacks, I had a great amount of fun with this game - I want to particularly highlight the emotions-as-weaknesses system, which is one of the combat elements that most excellently dovetailed with the game's general narrative and tone, and was the primary gameplay aspect that required some thought to determine what was most likely to be the right emotion to target. This was especially satisfying for the boss fights, where the bosses would have narrow weakness pools that changed each phase, making the player think through the context of the fight to figure out what emotion would hit hardest. Great mechanic, very well-implemented.

On the whole, Thirsty Suitors is a lot of things, and while plenty of those things are lacking in depth and can come off as "this game is so cool, let's put a little piece of it in ours" moreso than a well-considered design element, the themes and writing of the narrative more than make up for the mechanical deficiencies. Very much worth it.

Honestly, I would have played just because the art style and humor are so good.
But on top of that the story and characters are amazing.
I laughed (a lot), I cried (a lot), I pet the dog (a lot).
I loved playing a strong but messy queer female MC. I was definitely originally interested in the fact that it was a kind of dating simulator but once you go through the game I love that 

**Edit to add the one thing I completely forgot, THE SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS GAME IS KILLER!

I love the writing and adore the characters - the story is good, not great, but it gives good opportunity to explore the characters and their relationships.

The game play however is kinda bad. Not bad as in terrible, just mediocre and boring. The fact I'm still giving this a positive review I think is a good indication of how much I love these characters and how they are presented.

This is quite a bit of conditional recommendation.

Do you enjoy QTEs?
Do you enjoy low stakes stories?
Do you enjoy homecoming stories?
Do you enjoy 'indie' stories with flawed protagonists and quirky supporting casts?
Do you enjoy queer stories?
Do you enjoy being immersed in Brown immigrant culture in general and Indian culture in particular?
And again, do you enjoy QTEs?

The more you answer yes, the more you'll enjoy this game.

Thirsty Suitors is a game that knows what they want and skates right ahead to it, everything else be damned. It has an unique design, a lofty ambition, and an earnest heart and from the very start you're immediately diving into the world and its hilarious cast.

It's mostly light in tone...except with how it explores Jala, the protagonist. To Jala, this neon and pastel world might as well be Silent Hill with the way everyone calls out her mistakes and flaws and follies. But the contrast is exactly where the charm lies.

Gameplay wise...again, QTEs. QTEs everywhere. It's mostly low stakes and I'm fairly certain they have accessibilities options that will help you with some of these. But you'll see a lot of QTEs.

Honestly, this is the most fun I've had with a video game in a year with the exception of games I've played with friends. It's challenging sometimes, funny all the time, and honestly has a lot of good advice. I've never been mentored by a video game harder than this other than Mario teaching me that mushrooms are to be jumped on and not eaten. Only thing I can say to the devs: "I don't need to be targeted like this! I mean I like it, but lordy do I feel like you read some parts of my journal mates."

One of the most fun I've had with a game's writing this year, generally fun, really nice LGBTQ+ rep. Gameplay might become a bit repetitive so a warning to that.

I didn't come into this expecting much. Not really my kind of game. The controls are kind of clunky. Half the game is just QTEs.

And yet.

I got obsessed. Could barely put it down. The parts are messy, but it all comes together *so* well.

Scott Pilgrim vs The World meets Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.

Thirsty Suitors is an amazing Frankenstein of gameplay: cooking, skating, secret handshakes with dogs, and psychodrama battles with your exes. Classics, amiright?

Jala, our protagonist, is a horrible person (or was just your standard teenager). I loved playing her, going through every ex's boss battle and learning the dumpster fires that Jala made with so many people. This game plays all of that angst so well, and makes me crave a second game from this studio. The writing is excellent, the music is amazing, and the game is so so pretty.

I highly recommend this game, and encourage you to get it, sale or not. It's worth the money.

I'm only two hours in, and I can't wait to be a dozen more. This game is a gorgeously silly soup of genres that tastes absolutely amazing. The writing is fun and heartfelt, varied combat particularly with the taunt system, a completely unexpected skateboarding locomotion system (at least to me!!), and a bunch of fun combat mechanics doubling up as a cooking mini game.. loving it!

I had high hopes for Thirsty Suitors given the incredible work Outerloop had done with their previous title Falcon Age - and wow did they go above and beyond. Can't wait to play again!

Kudos to the team. Engaging, varied gameplay (Scott Pilgrim vs Tony Hawk vs Cooking Mama) but the writing and narrative clinches it for me. Some seriously laugh out loud moments, but I cared about Jala and how she'll move on and grow. Check out the game's team pedigree if you want convincing.

I managed to finish the game and I loved everything about it. Gameplay was fun, whether it was fighting or skateboarding or cookin. And the story was so well written, very emotional. And the best part has to be the art and the music. Really gets you immersed in the world and its style. I loved it.

Thirsty Suitors is a game that's not just about flashy graphics and catchy tunes. It's about real people, real struggles, and real emotions. The characters in this game are so well-developed that you feel like you're right there with them, experiencing their joys and sorrows.

The game doesn't shy away from tough topics like intergenerational conflict and emotional baggage. But it doesn't beat you over the head with it either. Instead, it presents these issues in a way that's both thought-provoking and relatable.

I absolutely loved how Thirsty Suitors didn't sugarcoat things with overly happy endings. It respected the emotional journey of the characters, allowing them to face real-life struggles and evolve in a way that felt genuine.

And let's not forget the music! The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful and perfectly complements the game's atmosphere. It's the kind of music that makes you want to stop and appreciate the moment.

Overall, Thirsty Suitors is a game that's worth your time. It's a game that will stay with you long after you've finished playing it.

DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review

Thirsty Suitors is a game developed by Outerloop Games and published by Annapurna Interactive

The game offers some nice graphics and a really beautiful aesthetic, it is pleasant all the same

The game does suffer with some repetitiveness at certain areas of the game but a fun game nonetheless

Thirsty Suitors overall, however, is a silly, beautiful game to play, it is a very good action adventure game to play in short bursts!

RECOMMENDED :)

I saw some people on youtube I'm sub'd to play this and it looked interesting, wasn't going to buy it though because I'm not a big skate game fan and I suck at QTE's. Checked out the trailer on youtube anyway but then made the stupid mistake of looking at comments and then saw some people calling this "woke" and that's what actually made buy. Generally when something is described as "woke" I tend to dig it.

So yeah, about an hour-ish in and it's a cool game. Skating around places is fun, I don't know if this has super in-depth skate board mechanics like in a game focused only on skating has so your mileage may vary. I loved the conversation fight with Sergio, I encountered another one with some bozo Jala's grandma sent to swoon me. It's a fun little spin on turn-based combat.

I love the visual aesthetic in this game, very stylish. The NPR (non-photo realistic for the non-game dev people out there) shading on stuff is wonderful, the painterly/illustrated textures are lovely. I'm playing on lower settings even though I could play on higher because this game gives me mad PS2 game vibes. It has some hints of Suda51's stuff like No More Heroes. Love the character designs, like Sergio is freakin' hilarious visually. Just... distilled, boiled down try-hard macho weirdo (But I do like him though, he seems like a cool guy to hang out with)

I think my favorite character so far even though I just met her is Jala's Aunt Chandra. Spinning a dumb-bell in her fingers like a drummer spins a drum stick? It's so extra but in the best possible way. Then she's like, dead-lifting tires attached to a bar bell. It's fantastic.

The music is cool too, love the jam that plays when your skating around town.

Oh and the voice acting! It's good stuff. Everyone has very natural and fitting delivery.

So yeah, I'll be playing some more but so far this is an enjoyable game. Just wanted to leave a review because I only see 35 at the time of writing this and want to do something to help the game succeed. There's a lot wacky shenanigans in the cards based on the trailer that I'm pretty excited for. Can't wait to get to the thick baddie and see what she's all about!

One of the best games about family I've ever played. Just fantastic dialogue from beginning to end with a dramatically exciting and heartwarming story that I can't recommend enough. And that entire climax! What a way to integrate/play with the gameplay that I'd been doing beforehand. No real downsides for me, this was a perfect game to play during the holidays when everything was chill (except for some family drama) and I could dive in and out when needed. Oh and I played this on Steam Deck and had no problems whatsoever! Felt great to play on it, and performed wonderfully.

From what I have played so far, everything this game does has been great. It has insane polish and even greater style in its presentation. The combat, while a tad basic, makes up for the relative lack of tactical depth with style and flair, as the battle represents a conversation.
The game is what I would describe as a mixture between Persona, Cooking Mama, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 & Scott Pilgrim wrapped up in a wonderfully queer cast of characters that highlights South Asian culture.
The protagonist Jala is deeply flawed, but is completely charming. I recommend this game immensely.

This is the best lgbt+ representation you will find anywhere, wrapped in a marvellous narrative with incredible voice-acting, smart dialogue and great humour. An enjoyable experience from start to finish, exploring with maturity many relevant issues.

Gameplay wise it is fun but not particularly challenging (although the skate bits can get hard). The gameplay is there to serve the narrative, but it is also tons of fun.

Queer-centric, Bollywood, Scott Pilgrim. This game is really really good. I do have some gripes when it comes to the narrative and how it leaves certain story lines somewhat hanging however, the game is fun, its funny, the art style is phenomenal; I was so sad when the credits rolled cause I just wanted more interactions with these characters.
Some will gripe about the price tag. I think that's dumb. This game isn't anywhere nearly as long as most AAA games and I think most gamers can come to the consensus that most of those games aren't worthy of their 60-70 dollar price tags despite attributes like length or graphical fidelity. This game asking 30, and very very frequently going on sale for 20, is far from ridiculous.

The story is amazing, and the battle style is also amazing. I love the humour, the characters, I love how the main character isn't meant to be a perfect person, or even a good person, and has character growth to become better. This game is really a hidden gem, especially if you like persona-like games and novels.

6+ hrs into the game and I just can't get enough of it.

All core mechanics I met so far: battle, cooking, skating - are well done, fun to master. I enjoyed the battle one most in the beginning, but now cooking got into me too. I'm even genuinely enjoying skating that's usually not among my favorite gameplays.

Dialogues are well written, witty and deep, topics meaningful, some lines you actually want to save for quoting to your friends later. I appreciate the good balance between drama and humor.

Moreover, soundtrack and English voice actors are too very very good. I'd say they play a big part in helping you dive into this fiction. And they making it real for you.

So I'd definitely recommend the game and I wish more people knew about this gem. This game is unique and one of a kind.

This game is an interesting blend between a cooking qte mini game, rpg with turn based qte battles and skating tricks. I personally didn't care much for the skating portion as it felt kinda slow to me. The battles are hilarious and every one of the suitors makes me cringe with how flawed they are personality wise. Makes me wanna root for the protagonist more. The cooking was enjoyable simply for the dialogue you get with your mom at first but then after that it's okay. You mostly use the cooking to give yourself consumables. I will say that this game is carried heavily by the dialogue and characters I feel. It's a good game but slightly flawed imo. Be warned the game did lock up on me completely once during a boss battle and for some reason the second time cooking Kiribath the spoken dialogue is absent for some odd reason. Other than that I really enjoy this unique game.

Have you ever tried to share the kitchen with your mom to cook something AND have an emotionally charged conversation at the same time? Thirsty Suitors got it!

This game was unlike anything I've ever played before. A truly wild, unique gameplay experience, with very varied mechanics. It doesn't take itself too seriously, as it is extremely deliberately over-the-top especially in battle sequences, but the writing is real and honest. The aspect of the story I loved the most was the family drama.

I had so much fun with this game, but it was so special in what it does that truly I'm not certain who to recommend it to. Unless... maybe everyone should play this?

Just finished the game, tons of laugh-out-loud moments and hilarious boss fights. Character designs were clearly lovingly imagined. I will say that the ending could have been a little more fleshed out, and the skate controls need more work. Still, I had a blast playing.

Thirsty Suitors plays with a rather unique premise, making its lead protagonist, Jala someone with a history of being... a less than stellar person haha... and having her return to her hometown to make amends with the friends and family she left hurt in her wake. Every character has an interesting personality, backstory, and relationship with Jala, all of which you will get to explore as you interact with / battle them.

The character design is fun and I really enjoyed the soundtrack.

The battling is done through a turn-based RPG style. Personally, I found the battle-system itself got a bit old after a while, but the zany animations and the crazy conversations during the battle certainly helped overcome that issue.

There is also a cooking mini-game that I adore, based more on QTEs, that lets you bond with your parents while also indulging in a bit of the food of your family's culture. If I recall, the food you make can also be used for buffs/heals/some side missions, so it also has a practical purpose

The skating is something I wish I had enjoyed more - and perhaps I would have if I'd invested more time in it. But what little I experienced didn't exactly bring me back to my childhood of Tony Hawk games. The skating functionality just seemed too limited for me to want to indulge in it much further and luckily the game doesn't really force you to do it anyway.

Overall, this game is a lot of drama, a lot of thirst, a hell of a good time.

I don’t normally play any of these genres, but I trusted the reviews on this one and I’m happy that I did. This game grabbed me from the start and I couldn’t put it down.

The mix of genres works very smoothly, fused together by the story. The social dynamics are intense and interesting, and are a real part of the battles, without slowing things down too much. So much drama!

The tensions inside a migrated south-Asian family are skilfully integrated into the game. The interactions with the dad are absolutely heartwarming. Jala is a mess but she’s fun and interesting to figure out.

ALSO: you can pet the dog.

Lovely queer mini Persona. Fights are little bit too much on easier side but mostly fine. They are quite fun but you will mostly spend doing the same in all of them. There is a lot of skating and I enjoyed most of it. Last few challenges are brutal and I never managed to S rank them but they are all optional and you don't even need to do them to get all achievements. Cooking mini-game is just QTE but with all that comments it was fun as well. Except the brutal difficulty spike with the last recipe that is needed for achievement.
What is best is how the game looks, all characters (dad rules tho) and overall feeling of the game. Story is fine but it fizzles out without any resolution in some parts.

Awesome game! I love the turn-based gameplay, the wackiness and the social commentary. The music and art are great. The story and characters are great too, but I feel there was more that could have been expanded on for it. More time developing the relationships with the other suitors. Other than that, i think this is worth your time! 8/10

i loved this game so much. it was every bit as good as i was hoping it would be. so stylish and over the top and confident in everything it does. it's able to hold so many things/topics at once and give them the love and care they deserve. it is as joyful as it is uncomfortable to play a bisexual brown woman who just constantly ♥♥♥♥♥ up. jala is peak girlfailure. sometimes i just want to be a brown girl who's allowed to ♥♥♥♥ up!! revolutionary!! thirsty suitors lets me live out that fantasy and i RELISHED in it. despite being so different from its protagonist in some ways, i felt so seen by this game. what a heartfelt and emotionally vulnerable and raw exploration of generational trauma, queerness, womanhood, family, and identity. and it does it all with so much wit. <3 a new favorite.

Thirsty Suitors is a great mix of turn-based strategy and cooking simulators with a side of skateboarding shenanigans. The quick-time events are really well implements and the "Scott Pilgrim vs the World but South Asian and queer" storyline is a lot of fun. I think the skating could have been implemented a bit more cleanly (I enjoyed some of the challenges, but some clunkiness got in the way of me finishing them) and the ending felt a bit removed from the overall narrative, but the overall experience was incredibly engaging. I finished in in two sittings across two days and would be happy to recommend it to anyone who enjoys heartfelt stories of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ up, finding out, and trying to do better.

The game isn't very long but it's packed with content.
Although fights themselves aren't very deep as far as mechanics are concerned, the dialogues are killer!

I didn't think I'd get as distracted by the skate challenges and cooking sequences as much as I did but they're a delight. The wholesome dad interactions are everything!

I /LOVE/ this game. Really. It's so good! The writing is amazing 10/10. Also, the art style is so unique! If you want to skate, cook, and fight off old + new suitors this is the game for you! The characters are really awesome, and I really enjoyed the story and the plots that focused on change, culture, growing up, sexuality, family, and learning how to love/forgive yourself. The game deserves more love! 10/10 would recommend.

An excellent game. The story is both fun and funny, with a wide cast of characters that are lovable. While characters are exaggerated for comic effect, the emotions and situations have a realistic feeling. Both combat (QTE heavy) and skateboarding are enjoyable if a bit basic. All and all, a very enjoyable way to spend 10-15 hours.

Just a truly, delightfully unhinged game (in a good way!). I'm not good enough to master a majority of the skateboarding challenges, but that didn't detract from the experience - the story, characters, music, and overall-style are top notch. (I would die for Jala's father!) Also so grateful for the representation and the reception this game has received. An impressive entry in a year of so many awesome games!

Only complaint: get yourself ready for some very-specific food cravings as you play!

… Timber Hills doesn’t feel like a video game playground, it feels like an actual trip home for the holidays where you bump into every single person you wanted to avoid.

A very nicely written story of tending to bad break ups and hoping of growing to be a better person in the process. With a good blend of humor to not make it just a sappy love drama. The added game play similar to classic Tony Hawk games was not expected but greatly appreciated. Overall a sweet game even for the most bitter heart

This game is such a joy. What if you took Scott Pilgrim, made it very gay and queer (in the most positive way possible), add in cooking mama, striking visuals, JoJo posing, and Persona 5 and then just blended it all together with a nice seasoning of generational trauma and the plight of first generation american children. That's what this game is. It's a joy to play, to watch Jala grow and make amends for the harm she's caused during her life prior to the start of the story. It's heart wrenching watching her struggle against the entirely valid criticisms and hurt rage of the people she left in her wake.

It also handles the big criticism I had of Scott Pilgrim which was that it felt like everyone forgave Scott too easily for his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Here, no one outright forgives Jala. They recognize the trauma and pain but do work towards a resolution with her. It's honest and genuine.

This is a good game, but not a game I'd ordinarily play or recommend. It is driven, for me, by the writing and the voice acting. I ended up dreading confrontations in the game because they felt real enough. The mechanics work well enough, though if you're expecting a great skate game or a great JRPG-style turn-based battler, tone the expectations down, there's mechanical depth but it's not going to be a stand-out in either of those two categories (perhaps as a consequence of doing both at once). Now, on the other hand, if you like well-voice acted QTE/rhythm-based gameplay and you don't mind having to do some skate-parkour every now and again, this is the game for you on a purely mechanical basis.

But I'm not recommending it on a mechanical basis, I'm recommending it because I think the mechanics ultimately serve the narrative well, and heighten stakes and dramatic tension accordingly, as the protagonist, Jala trying to reconcile the stress and effort of being a more emotionally mature person while I'm struggling with the stress and effort of nailing a long QTE. I think it is, as a holistic endeavor, the sort of "battle game where you get to know people through fighting" that I wanted Persona to be, and this review cannot do it justice. It's worth the asking price, and the 4-5 hours it would probably take to just get through the story.

Sweet and funny. Beautiful story. Fun combat (I will say it felt too easy sometimes, but still was ok).

Loved all the animations of the special attacks and tauns! The boss fights were the best part of the game, specially the last 2.

Grateful to see a game with so much queer representation as well :)

7/10 ⭐

I love it. The music is nice, the roleplay is really fun and enables you to dive into indian's culture and discover many desi characters that are fun and unique. The missions are fun and the concept is completely unique. And its a huge premiere in terms of representation for the queer desi community. Thank you, thank you, thank you.

One of my favourite games of the year! Loved the story, art and animation, plus the skateboarding was smooth too. I know not everyone is a fan of QTE focused gameplay but I liked it (Especially for the cooking parts of the game!)!

Turn-based battles with strong rhythm-based mechanics! There's also a whole tony hawks pro skater game in here and it's all wrapped in a wonderful story with nuanced dialogue. Nothing's quite like reliving familial tensions

Love it! Unique theme for a game with twist on turn based combat.

You battle your ex's or suitors through funny and witty dialog, choosing taunts to throw them off their game.

I really like this game!

Story is nice, animations and dialogs are top notch. Artstyle is fun and colorful. The battles are fun bun a bit too lenghty for my taste.

My biggest ccomplain atm is the skateboarding mechaniccs - controls are simplier than in tony hawk's but often I'm getting snapped to wrong rail. Other problem is that I'm not having control over camera - I cccan't look around.

Overall - I really recommend this game if you like story driven games with dating sim mechanics.

I was absolutely hooked when I played the demo during Steam Next Fest and I was not disappointed by the full release. Thirsty Suitors is extremely fun and extra, main character keeps doing flips and dialogue made me crack up so many times. And on the other hand it made me emotional, cry and made me appreciate what I have. As a queer person some of the topics and themes in the game really hit home, in the best way. Outerloops did an amazing job with this.

10/10 ✨

Also around the start of the game I vowed to get the S ranking on all skate boarding challenges and I frigging did it 🛹💨

So Jala inspired me to do more cartwheels and flips in my everyday activities.

Bad news, I shattered my legs.

Good news, I now have more free time to play this fantastic game!

An amazingly beautiful game that gave me a lot of Persona-vibes. One of the reasons why I bought it in the first place. It has amazingly well written characters, fun gameplay, a really wonderful graphics style and all in all is just something I binged through without a break.

such a fun and stylish game with lots of heart! Fantastic music and voice acting, such good characters <3

I don't enjoy skating games or quick time event mechanics, so I thought I might not get through it- but the skating is pretty much optional. And the QTEs are actually fun! There's plenty of accessibility options if you don't want to do them as well.

Don't let the name put you off- it's less of a dating sim and more a drama imo. I really liked how all the different relationships were resolved- felt very realistic and sincere.

10/10 would secret handshake a dog again ^_^

I loved this game so much!! So exciting to be able to relate to a game so easily and also have it be so gorgeous and fun! I laughed I cried (more than any person should probably) and could not stop playing. I usually dont like turn based fighting games but this one was different enough to keep me engaged the whole time. The art style in this is incredible--everything was so beautiful and vibrant and the music was so good.
