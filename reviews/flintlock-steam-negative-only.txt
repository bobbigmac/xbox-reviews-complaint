Definitely not terrible, and entirely acceptable for the price, but leaves a lot to be desired. I'm a bit conflicted.

It's a beautiful game with a familiar dynamic and engagement, and some good features. But it feels unrefined, a bit bland, often just a lot of empty space with sparse enemies, and occasionally clunky. This is certainly anecdotal, but I was streaming this for six hours today and was regularly asked if it was in early access. The consensus seemed to be that it looked incomplete, like a good skeleton for a game that wasn't fleshed out yet. (And, for whatever reason, the audio balancing is all out of whack. I turned down sound effects so I could hear the dialogue, but certain attacks blasted at full volume and most of the dialogue from anyone but the main character was 30% lower than it should be.)

One thing i have to point out before: I have fun with the game.

But! Unfortunately i cannot recommend the game without remorse. It feels like the Developer ran out of money in the end.

The audio is not balanced out (loud NPCs, quiet NPCs, no spatial sound for NPCs talking next to you) -

The core systems has potential - Movement, Fighting, Skillsystem

And there are quite a few things that are fun to play - shooting the musket, change between ranged and close combat immediately, traversing the world.

But Number 2! Overall it just feels not finished (and i´m not talking about "polished"). There are a lot of parts and mechanics in the game, where you realize that they are not implented well or were put in the game just to fill the space. (Shops, The Gambling-Game)


I´m sad to give a thumbs down, but i think this game could (AND SHOULD) be more. Nonetheless i would recommend it for a sale.

This game feels unfinished. The store page describes it as "Souls-lite", and that's what it is - in the worst possible ways. "Lite" on the build depth and variety. "Lite" on the difficulty. "Lite" on the content and length of the damn game! I completed the main story, including all side quests, all "Enki feathers" and all shrines... in 11.6 hours. I played on normal, so maybe the hard difficulty is more of a challenge, but the big bosses were trivial. Even the final boss fell over pretty quick. And the story is nothing to speak of. Oh, and the game kept crashing for me. Thankfully the game seems to save its state before exiting, even on a crash, so I never lost any progress.

Don't get me wrong, I had some fun. I wouldn't have spent 11.6 hours on it if there was no fun to be had. It's particularly satisfying to switch between melee and ranged combat relatively fluidly. Or to shoot a suspiciously-well-placed explosive barrel to clear a pack of enemies. But that fails to make up for everything the game lacks.

Overall I think this game is criminally undercooked. The concept and world had decent potential, and the combat isn't terrible either, so given a few more years of development, I could see this game being pretty good. Sadly what we got was just mediocre on almost all levels. I wouldn't suggest you pay much more than $10 for it.

The game is not terrible. It looks great and I've had no performance issues. However, I can't recommend it because the balance is simply terrible. The game can't decide whether it wants to be Assassin's Creed or a Souls game, so it veers wildly and unexpectedly between difficulties in way that I found persistently irritating. Most of the time the game is Assassin's Creed, a fun game that requires little technical gaming expertise. In Flintlock, you follow the quest marker, parkour over obstacles that are clearly marked in white or zip through rifts that give you an infinite amount of time to choose your direction. If you wander around, you find resources or hidden treasure chests. The game might be more like God of War, but the writing in Flintlock is so dull that I don't want to make the comparison. Flintlock's writing is dull like Assassin's Creed Valhalla is dull. But, from time to time and without warning, the game turns into a Souls-like game. The parkour in the Black Powder factory, for example, is not really difficult but if you haven't fallen to your death 1,000,000 times in Elden Ring to get the Thumbprint Shield, you might not be used to missing your jumps. The game does not prepare you for the first boss fight, for example, which has 3 phases and requires good parrying skills. That's not a bad thing if the rest of the game had the same vibe. But it doesn't. I loved the Parade Master fight in Lies of P, it was engaging and taught you about the game you were about to play. I don't like the swings in difficulty in Flintlock. The combat in its open world is from a different game than the boss combat. And I'm not an impatient player, it took me 2 days to learn to dodge and beat Consort Radahn, and 4 days to learn to kill the Nameless Puppet. But Flintlock doesn't inspire me to put the time in because the game, as a whole, doesn't inspire that kind of commitment. If its gameplay were more cohesive or its story more interesting, I might feel differently. Perhaps the devs will retune the game in an update.

Completed the main story but really can't recommend. Feels unfinished in too many areas which is probably reflected in the price. Combat/traversal has cool moments and ultimately it could've been something but isn't.

Main character is not likable. First time she tries to get help from a god and she tries killing him, super annoying to listen to. The combat isn't fluid, clunky compared to other souls-like games such as Lies of P.

I really want to like this game but there's so many conflicting issues with it from the sub par story to the confusing aesthetics settings to the jank combat to the terrible optimization.

Game just feels too unfinished & undercooked to where I just sadly can't recommend it :(

I know I really haven't play much of it, but as a game marketed as a souls-like or souls-"lite" (I'm unsure what it really means by lite either), I wouldn't recommend it to people that are looking to cover the souls-like itch. This game probably a lot of fun for a lot of people, but I think it's worth pointing out why not all souls players may not enjoy this. HOWEVER! Try the game for yourself please, as I do think there are a lot of good aspects to this game, but it just doesn't click for me.

The Good:
- The core game mechanics are cool, it's a well thought out combat system. Gun for countering red attacks, dodging is always viable, and parrying will always be fun.
- You are more mobile than most souls-likes
- Ran very well
- Visually looks good

The things that turned me away personally:
- The enemies feel very generic, and feels like there is no difference in the factions presented early on. This however could change with more game time.
- Parrying just doesn't have the "umpf" that I would like out of a parry, and is way to easily rewarding as well. That's a personal preference, but it's worth mentioning.
- Red attacks (for how punishing they are) come out way to fast. The gun is supposed to be a counter measure, but when the enemy flashes red for a half of second I'm barely even pulling the trigger yet.
- Enemy placement is actually ridiculous. Each encounter I faced had 3 enemies at the same time, and the game doesn't give you the tools to really deal with that many enemies at once. Maybe it doesn't feel as bad on lower difficulties, but on an encounter to encounter basis the enemy placement feels unbalanced for the highest difficulty. It's like Dark Souls 2.

Not worth it at full price. Game is "OK", but not good. Combat is loose and never feels precise. Traversal is equally loose feeling like you're never sure if you're going to miss your jumps. Story is uninteresting, but who plays for that anyway. Voice acting is ok, but the audio is produced poorly, so your characters voice is loud while many NPC voices are super quiet. Performance is ok on my system, but overall the game is kinda bland and boring. Mostly trash enemies with unpolished combat. Its the kind of game that you buy on sale when you don't have anything else to play. Its the kind of game that isn't even worth trying to get good at because the combat is boring and unpolished, so you just set it to story mode and button mash through it till another better game comes along. Also, Just had a boss bug out on me. Mid fight he just started standing there in the arena motionless. Had to quit and reload. This game is cheaply made. One final annoying thing, parrying is a core mechanic which I like, but 75% of the time enemies do their unblockable attack which you can't block or parry and have to dodge. Lots of enemies do unblockables almost exclusively so it takes the fun of having a parry machanic right out of the game. Its kinda stupid. One more final thing, visually the game looks terrible in some areas, like unplayable terrible. No matter how you set the gamma control, the game looks either too dark or completely washed out or both. The game looks you set the contrast control on your system all the way down, so all the blacks look medium grey. It washes the game out visually making it super hard to see. Some areas are worse than others. Needs an immediate fix, I actually can't even play the current zone I'm in cause it looks so bad. Seriously don't buy this game till its patched and on sale for like 5 bucks.

Update: After finishing the game and giving it a solid chance, I have to say that its complete crap. Most games get better as you play them, but this one just gets worse. Its a real stinker. Gameplay is comically bad. I initially said the gameplay was "ok", but now I can confidently say that its just cheap trash. I spent my whole playthrough laughing about how terrible it is.

Honest Review:

Combat 8/10 (its fun and it can be rewarding depends on what difficulty you will play the game, there are variety of finishers and different builds u can approach i just found the dodge button a little bit off timer like i had delay on some moments.

Story 7/10 the story is good but i found it empty a little bit, there are 3 big bosses in game total and the cuts scenes between them are great. Enki is decent and not annoying at all. Nor in other hand i found her cringe and her dialogs are not great. The best part of the game was the ending. (It was decent and i found it touchy)

Content 5/10 the only reason why i do not recommend this game is because the lack of variety of npcs, most of exploring feels stupid all u can find is some crafting materials and from time to time and useless wepons.
There are like 10 models of enemy and most of time have same attack patterns. At first i wanted to explore every corner of the game but than the more i played the more i was losing my satisfaction. Just felt not worthy so I decided to focus on the main objective and just finish the game.

This game could be so much if they if they had bigger budged and more time to deliver.

The game has 3 different maps with 4 main bosses and whole world filled no rewards for exploration and pointless chests and crafting materials.

I finished the game and I would only recommend it on sale. If you can get it for 10-15 $ it can be decent.
And no do buy deluxe edition its poitnless.

I want you to remember what thing. This is not Sony, Fromsoftware or any super big studio.
The dev really pushed them self so ill give them some credit. The game is not terrible but its not great either.

i can't in good faith recommend this game, although it's not terrible, is not good either, so i dont recomend at full price just get it on deep sale or on gamepass

Frustratingly jank. I hope the dev continues working on it, because the good (mostly the visuals and worldbuilding) are sadly vastly outweighed by a combat system that on the hard difficulty simply demands more than it can deliver.

I hope the devs continue working in the industry, be it on this game or on their next project

Man, I really wanted to like this game. Performance is great. No issues with frame rates or anything of that sort. The story is interesting and I love the look of it. However it suffers from actual game play. While the "souls-lite" is there, the way it works is pretty linear. Walk towards a junction, choose left or right, fight bad guys in a straight line using janky combat mechanics, rinse and repeat. There is no sense of exploration and the backgrounds are easily forgettable. The skill tree used is very limited and doesn't really give you a choice in how the combat unfolds. So it doesn't matter if you want to play offensively or defensively, it will always feel the same. The very small areas you can "explore" becomes frustrating due to the janky and sluggish movement mechanics that was clearly designed for combat only usage. Trying to traverse areas becomes a chore. I really wanted to like this game and I really wanted to get this game as I loved Ashen, but this is not it. This feels more of a step back. I mean that, its not even a as good as Ashen. It truly is a step back from the mechanics that you come to expect. There is a reason the game says to use a controller as I tried both keyboard and controller. K&M is more frustrating then even the secret final boss of some games. So use a controller. I do not recommend this at full price, I recommend this when its at a steep discount. At least 50% off is what you want.

Story is nonexistent
Characters likewise are paper thin
Combat is wokny, dodge is near useless
Main weapons barely differ from each other

Overall my take is that the tea, bit on more than they could chew, this could be great, but it's not. Ashen was even worse though, so here's hoping their third game will happen and it will be better.

Gave it a chance. The movement system is neat, but looks/feels very janky. Combat is janky and not satisfying. Enemy variety isn't great. There is just a general lack of polish and this game has the feel of trying to do too much yet failing to do any one of those things well. I was expecting some AA jank, but there's very little charm to it in this game. Honestly, it feels like a raw alpha. Maybe pick up on a deep, deep sale. I hope the devs work on polishing up the game and improving it because a lot of the core mechanics have such potential. Such a disappointment.

Broken on ultrawide screens. Game renders zoomed in. Increasing FOV can help, but it might require editing the configs for your preference. Can't play the game at 16:9 either as it just stretches it. How are we still seeing games release with these problems?

Beyond this, Flintlock is a sloppy mess of a game. It feels arbitrarily put together with souls like mechanics glued on to be on trend. The combat is shallow and imprecise. The maps are dull with nothing interesting to explore and bloated in size. The teleportation traversal mechanic is obviously spread throughout the map to make getting across it less of a chore. The gameplay loop is to raid a camp, unlock its rest point, and get your next quest. Rinse and repeat. For some reason your feathery dog friend is constantly teleporting to keep up with you and this sounds like an annoyingly loud explosion. Terrible.

It has so many things wrong with it that it's just not worth my time to explain in detail. Basically the combat is messy and janky. The first hour of the game is one big long tutorial because there are way too many different combat mechanics. The game is optimized like a wet fart so they included DLSS because without it, it would run like pure ass. And even with it, the worst thing about the game is that it has horrific stutter-locking which is why I'm pretty much done with it because for me it's unplayable. I got it cheap outside of steam so it's not refundable otherwise I would've refunded it within a half hour. It did nothing more than make me want to play through Elden Ring again, even if it didn't have sickening stutter-locking.

Was interested in the world and art style but the combat in this game just isn't fun for me. Despite going for a faux-bloodborne style of promoting agression and interrupting attacks using your pistol, the combat just feels to inaccurate and floaty to my liking and between that and a very vague story, there just wasn't a reason to continue on.

"Hey! From Software has spent their last 7 games perfecting a compelling and tough-but-fair combat system; let's take all the lessons they learned, and all the changes they made, and do NONE OF THAT." -The people who made Flintlock

TLDR: 5/10 buy at discount or go get GamePass

Just finished the game, a short and bittersweet experience. Has the same sort of half-baked souls-like feel that the first Lords of the Fallen had. It's 90% there, but the that last missing 10% make the combat almost unbearable at any difficulty higher than Story (which you don't get achievements for, which i get, but y'know, ♥♥♥♥ you). When LotF came out it was kind of understandable, cause the souls genre wasn't very big at the time, but we live in the height of the souls-saga, and there are a plethora of games that have made these exact same mistakes before. There is nothing wrong with learning from other's mistakes.

And for the love of God, fix the audio mixing. The un-skipable story cutscenes, boss fight music, npc dialogue, and the earsplitting opening splash art when you boot the game all play at MAX volume, no matter what you have the master volume at. I literally can't hear the dialogue during boss fights.

The setting is well done and interesting, and the story is... fine. The voice actors have their ups and downs.

I actually had to refund this game.

From the creators of Ashen. Truly marvelous game. Great setting, great story, breathtaking soundtrack, soulslike battles. So great.

Then there's Flintlock.
Storywise: The game instantly makes you hate the protagonist. Let's just say, you don't build strong female lead character like that. And the story: destroy a barrier, from which comes a horde of undead, only to be a turnaround, when it happens to be the other way around and it locks some gods away that you need to kill now? Not enticing at all.
Gameplay: Soulslike. Fells a bit clunky and unpolished on release. Timings of blocking and rolling is a bit off too. But that was my skill-issue.
Soundtrack: Like the Ashen, the composer is e.hillman. Amazing soundtrack, but it's cursed to be on this flopping game.

All in all, the story and the protagonist made it not interesting and killed all the joy i had for this game. I wanted to learn all the mechanics and the world in Ashen, but here it's blank and bleak.

The game is fun but the controls are way too floaty. The difficulty level of enemies seems to roller coaster from encounter to encounter. Dodges don't have any kind of invincibility frames from what I can tell; they just physically move the character, but you can still be hit. The characters are hollow. I literally cannot name a single one after 5 hours of playing. Exploration in the world feels empty and mostly unrewarding.

The biggest peeve for me happened after 5 hours in. While I was messing around in the options menus, I accidentally set the game to easy. I changed the difficulty back before unpausing the game, but now the game has permanently disabled my ability to unlock achievements and I have to make a fresh playthrough if I wish to continue unlocking them. I understand that won't be a big issue for other people, but when the game is only around 8-10 hours long to 100%, having to completely restart that far in is quite annoying.

There's also this weird board game minigame you can play with various NPCs around the map called Sebo. I did not enjoy it. It doesn't have any impact on the story or game whatsoever. It just seems really odd and tacked on. It's almost like the developers wanted to make 2 totally different games, but there wasn't enough content or depth to Sebo to make it it's own thing.

Overall I was disappointed in Flintlock. I thoroughly enjoyed A44's previous game, Ashen, and have beaten that game multiple times. I highly recommend Ashen to any Souls-like fans. Flintlock seems like a step backwards from Ashen in almost every aspect.

Putting the politics surrounding this game aside, I'm not sure I can recommend it at full price. (It's available on gamepass) There is some fun to be had, but can I justify it given the issues I encountered?

The story wasn't all that interesting to follow, and I experienced terrible performance while streaming/recording with OBS. While the performance was generally fine otherwise, I've never had a game interfere with my keyboard's RGB lighting, causing it to shut off everytime this game is launched, along with Shadowplay.

There's better synergy between Enki and Nor as you unlock more skills, which improves the overall combat. However, it can get very repetitive, especially in the beginning. Something feels missing overall for me.

I love the boss designs, but due to how the combat feels, I don't get the level of satisfaction. Also enemy variety is lacking.

The exploration did improve as I progressed to other regions, and I love the scenery.

However, my gripe with the camera remains when playing on MNK. It's probably the worst of any souls-like game I've played. Despite lowering the in-game settings and DPI, dealing with multiple enemies makes the camera ping pong between them. I don't have control of my character and executing what I want. So your experience may be better if you play this on controller.

I've beaten the game, but I'm left with mixed feelings about my experiences with Flintlock. I hope to see things improve in future titles.

Wish there was a neutral rating because the game is just ok. I really wanted to like it, but ultimately went negative because of how slow it feels to move on the map even when sprinting and the lack of steam deck compatibility (it runs on it, but its not smooth experience especially when you need to parry).

Pros:
- Combat felt fluid and fun. The combination of using all the possible tools to get a kill felt really good.
- The experience/souls system. Essentially you can build up a combo meter that increases the amount of souls/essence/dust you receive, but resets if you take a hit. Using different methods to hit an enemy increases the meter even faster. Excellent risk/reward system.

Cons:
- Slow movement outside of combat. Yes they provide fast travel teleport things, but I'm talking about the general walking/sprinting is extremely slow.
- Not optimized well for Steam Deck. It works, but it's not very smooth so it ruins the experience.
- Exploring did not feel fun and had no interest in doing it (probably bc i was already annoyed by the movement speed)

Overall the game is ok if you have a souls-lite itch to scratch, but if you plan to play this on the go, try something else.

Sadly the game is mediocre in pretty much every aspect..

To name a few points:
- The graphics are generally not bad but also not good. There is simply no location that stands out
- The parkour/climbing works so and so and often the ledge grab does not work properly
- From a technical perspective it seems to work fine and just once I had a bug where I opened the menu and suddenly my framerate tanked for several minutes
- The protagonist is horribly annoying from start to finish. The story is pretty dull, the characters lack any depth and the connection between the protagonist and Enki is as shallow as a puddle.
- The combat mechanics or rather the souls-like/lite mechanics are pretty unnecessary and the game would probably be better without it.

If you have some time to kill and the game does not cost more than ~15€/$ it is probably "okay" but do not expect to much from it.

I wanted to refund game, but just passed the 2 hr mark. Very unoptimised, no real graphics settings, clunky gameplay mechanics, linear gameplay, no story worth hearing, gets boring and repetitive quickly. Plus no ps controller buttons for a game released on playstation, come on. Feels like it should've had the get out of making a finished game "early access" title. I also disagree with forcing people to play on normal or higher to get any trophies. Before anyone comments "git gud", have played on normal and higher. My complaint is for the casual player who may want to play and the shouldn't be put off by elitist ways from a wonky game that plays horrible. Has moments, but not enough to justify price at moment. Will not recommend in it's current state.

Well people were right then they said the game is garbage story and character feels like written by twelve year old kid who was lazy at the time combat feels really bad every aspect of it is bad and there is extra stupid difficulty system put on player where you get experience for attack combos not for defeated enemies, so you either get good or quit the game

Mouse has some sort of weird smoothing enabled and no option to remove it. Why not just use raw mouse input? It's so much better and matches how people already use their mouse.

Seems to be a less popular game so there aren't even any mods to fix the bad mouse setup. Devs, if you release on PC, please make sure your mouse movement doesn't suck.

I really want to like this game, but the combat is sooo.......sloppy. And the parkour is absolutely horrendous!! On a double jump or midair dodge you might end up facing a completely different direction. You might grab the ledge, or you might not! Who knows?? I'm still having fun....I think?? Don't think I can recommend it right now though.

so far the game is just not for keyboard and mouse. they have some options to customize some things, but it seems half of them do nothing. the mouse lock target switching option does not appear to work. changing from qwerty doesn't really work. rebinding some keys occasionally works. somehow i got my game to crash over and over for rebinding block to a mouse button, had to reset to default to get through the tutorial. maybe they'll fix it, maybe i'll change my review. but so far its not been a good experience at all.

The combat responses are slow, and at time unresponsive. Keyboard bindings reset if you map it to the wrong button (i.e. using mouse scroll to dodge resets EVERYTHING back to default once you try and save...extremely frustrating and time consuming). If the combat moves were more responsive, it would be a more enjoyable time.

How the hell do I turn off that 'Mouse target switching'? Is this thing broken or what? I thought Vampyr did a terrible job with this, but at least you could turn it off.

Otherwise, I am conflicted about this. The good thing is that this game is easy on normal difficulty, so I don't need to repeat the same thing over and over again.

I may change my recommendation later if they fix this.

I would say the game is fun but the combat in the beginning is so dull and broken and unfun I cant say you should get it. the parry just wont work half the time, you dodge an attack and the enemy just turns around mid attack to hit you anyways. polish your combat and then maybe its worth the price

Changing my review, do not buy this game, it is brutal, combat is ♥♥♥♥, character movement is ♥♥♥♥, the entire blocking and dodging system is ♥♥♥♥, enemies can basically one to two hit kill you while it will take you a minimum of three hits to take down a minor tier enemy, and that is when your hits register as many do not land!

This is not a bad game but a lot of things that could have made it a lot better.
1. It is to short to be a full game. Comparing to Forspoken or Dragon Age which are much bigger and longer games , this one is just like a demo.
2. It's to linear, it's like I'm running most of the time by a predrawn line and with no way of to the sides to explore mm.
3. The loot system, well no joy there.
4. Enemies are to few and sometimes just empty space to run in.
5. It's to expensive for so a short game.

As I said, the game is not bad but I wish the dews had put some more effort in making it more playable and longer.
So I do not recommend this game, sorry.

This is an ALMOST for me.
Game is ALMOST there...
I WANTED to like it, but a huge something is missing..
It just feels like every other souls game reskinned with same old mechanics, with different story without anything special except maybe the gun but it doesnt bring that much interest cause the other parts of the game bring it down.
(*ahem no multiplayer, not really refined, no precision?)

Also game using 70% of my 4080 gpu in the menu is a big nono.
(BTW There is ONLY 60 fps or unlimited in the settings.. wtf? so 70% gpu usage at 60fps with vsync off..???????!?!o_O?!O_o?!?!??!?!)
Turning the graphics to medium to have it at 60% doesnt make use of my gpu. Also it makes my cpu to 100% usage when i start it up every time is a risk for a hard crash.
Why should i put my comp in danger because game isnt optimized?

Go play Throne & Liberty that game is so well made and free.

Good graphics and Story so far. But terrible Souls game. Almost all attacks from everything you fight are uninterruptible or not parry-able, followed by the fact dodging doesn't move you character at all. You basically are just forced to take damage if you have no bullets to interrupt or run around in circles like a chicken to avoid attacks. When you double dodge you actually move a distance away, but then the enemy will now gap close you since double dodge take forever to happen.

Game-play mechanics are to clunky to be a souls-like. You spend most your time waiting for abilities to recharge since combat is impossible without them. With the fact they forced combo your fights gain skill points, it's a lot of a waiting game for resources to come back than just being able to rely on your own skill with parry or dodge.

Thought it was solid at first but after playing a bit further I feel like the combat is very floaty and the parry system sucks pretty bad. Also still not very well optimised. Absolutely do not spend more than 15-20 bucks on this game.

"This game is frustrating to play. The graphics are nice but ordinary. The character controls are terrible and stiff. It's hard to control the character, and reloading is a pain. The enemies shoot rapidly, and by the time you swing your axe, you've been hit three times. When you're close to dying, the character still walks around use potion bottles. I fine plese hit me. The guard stance requires the character to stand straight, and you have to complete the entire action scene before moving on. Dodging is impossible until the attack animation finishes. I bought it because of the positive reviews and the discount, but I'm completely disappointed."

I initially approached this game with an open mind, despite the considerable noise and criticism surrounding it. However, I regret not heeding the warnings. To start, the game crashed multiple times, a glaring issue that should have been addressed before release.

Once I managed to get past the crashes, I found the gameplay to be exceedingly disappointing. This is perhaps the most generic and uninspired attempt at a Dark Souls clone I have ever encountered. The game world is dull, devoid of meaningful content, and utterly unengaging. The difficulty level is egregiously unbalanced, making it a frustrating and unrewarding experience. For reference, I completed Elden Ring and found it thoroughly enjoyable, but this game felt more like a tedious chore rather than an having fun.

Adding to the dismal experience is the overt agenda-pushing by the developers. The inclusion of certain characters, particularly a black female protagonist, felt forced and disingenuous, clearly a result of pandering to DEI mandates rather than genuine storytelling. This misplaced focus detracts from the game and alienates players. Moreover, the involvement of SBI in the game's development has predictably led to another failure. The pattern is clear: their influence consistently results in subpar products, and this game is no exception.

From a technical standpoint, the game feels incomplete and poorly optimized. Charging $40 for such an unfinished product is not just unreasonable; it's exploitative. I wouldn't be surprised if the player base dwindles to single digits within a month, forcing the game to go to free-to-play model out of sheer necessity.

In summary, this game is a prime example of how not to develop and market a video game. It is uninteresting, unenjoyable, and grossly overpriced. The negative reviews are justified, and I strongly advise against purchasing this game. Save your money and your time.

The game itself is good and in my opinion there is nothing to complain about but it is too short...

... definitely too short for such a price... which is why I cannot recommend it and give it a positive recommendation. At this price, this game should be x 3 longer and unfortunately it is very short and very expensive...

i find myself wanting to like this game so badly, but at present time i don't due to some very unrealized features, the biggest of which being the combat. the combat is slightly unique but is also janky in some very bad ways leading to it rarely feeling super fluid and cool. The whole system of using a pistol to stop certain attacks could be cool, if every single enemy didn't almost exclusively do the red attacks. The parrying also feels off and unreliable at times. When you hit most enemies, they have little to no reaction to being struck with an axe (this is stupid). Sabo is the most dog ass Gwent like, in world, game iv'e ever seen in my life. The traversal mechanics are really enjoyable when the character does what you want her to. There also seems to be a lack of weight to every and anything your character does in this game. The best example of which being when i fell too far and died. Before the death screen came up my character hit the ground and with no rag doll or any effects just slid off screen like a mannequin. The way she moves especially while in the air is so weightless {in a bad way}. There seems to be some kind of cap or brake keeping you from feeling fast or too agile. I hope with time the developer can show more love to what is certainly an early access game. There's too much to the combat that is frustrating and under cooked for me so no i cant recommend this game.
If you are a souls fan, this is no where in the realm of souls.
I wonder if the money that went to useless DEI being funneled into the actual development of the game systems would make the game feel more complete. Pick this up if you can get it for under 20$.
Edit-
I was gifted this by a friend, so i will now play through it.

IT'S NOT A RPG
First off, it's neither an RPG nor or Souls-like. You have NO meaningful build path or many choices.
You have an 1h axe and a pistol. That's basically it. There are some minor variances and options but you can't really "choose" a different weapon to main.
There are no stats to level and no "loot" to find

There are 3 minor skill trees, one for each melee-gun-magic pet with varying degrees of combat impact (charged attack, dodge attack, jump slam etc).

You can upgrade your weapons in a very minor way (e.g. +4 damage)

GAMEPLAY
It feels both floaty, unprecise and sluggish at the same time. I have no clue why that 1h axe behaves like it's the heaviest 2h hammer - the animation lock is INSANE. An enemy can be in a neutral walking animation and during the time it takes you to attack, they can make an attack that hits you. Paired with the fact that you CAN NOT CANCEL the animation, neither during start-up nor recovery, makes this extremely tedious to engage with even basic enemies, since you absolutely need to always bait an attack or abuse hit-and-run strategies.

Then you have a super weird parry timing, which takes some time to get used to. The animation is super quick and doesn't last long, so you basically have to wait till the enemy is basically a few inches away from hitting you during his swing, instead of the typical parry timing of "at the start of the swing".

Very early on you get introduced to your "magic" pet, which deals no damage but increases a visible "stagger" bar, which you need to fill up via the magic pet attack and your normal attacks. What makes it incredible tedious, is that it's not an effect on top of the gameplay system, it's a MANDATORY way to deal with "armored" enemies, since they take so little damage, you need to stagger them first and remove their armor with the critical attack. This bogs down every fight against armored enemies and enforces that playstyle. Awful.


SOULS-LIKE?!
I don't think this qualifies very much. It's a bit similar, but diverges heavily in most aspects and is more akin to an action character game.

- There is no stamina to manage
- There are no stats to level
- No different weapons or builds
- No character creator or starting classes
+ Areas are similar to some Sekiro-level design
+ You lose your souls when you die and can recover them
+ You have some sort of estus flask

VERDICT
It's too limited in depth and too unfun and inflexible in its combat that it's worth it. With some minor tweaks to improve the combat feel I would try it again, but the animation lock is really bad.

5/10. Poor soulslike + god of war similarities. Too much woke agenda. If you have nothing to play and on sale, maybe. Better than Forspoken but still meh.

If a mobile bad game with horrible perspective, linear experience, bad voice over, and clunky combat could have a baby...well, it wouldn't need to because this would be it. Where is the left handed support? If I wanted a controller game I'd buy an Xbox. I rue the day I bought this clunker. 1 out of 10 (had good graphics).

So much wrong with this game. I can't really even nor want to play at this point. I should have read reviews first. Oh well, got burned. Souls games just are not fun and this is not even a "souls lite" like they've touted. I did get on a deep sale but shame I can't get a refund. C'est La Vie.

sorry dev guys, i just can't give it a like, I just can't
you know what, it could have been a good game, and it got the potential, I can assure that.
it is just ehhh
you know, for a game that focus on that so called immersion feeling, most of the time the very thing you will face is the back of the protagonist's head.
ok, and have you guys ever taken a darn close look at the head back of the protagonist?
I mean
it's gross (￣_,￣ )
yeah, and it has nothing to do with anything else, it just doesn't have any sense of design

oh my
sweet baby inc really ruined everything they touched didn't they

I thought with mods fixing the character, I could play it. But the combat is trash.

This game is terrible.
It may get better, they may fix some of the many bugs.
But it is fundamentally a bad game. And that is without entering into the woke-ness that is steamrolled into it. (In the future I’ll try to be more careful with my money.) I suggest you don’t waste your money, or your time. Avoid this game, until it is extensively fixed, and greatly cheaper.

So basically God Of War meets Dark Souls and end up like Forspoken...

This game is a mess, stutters like crazy for no reason, looks bad most of the time, the gameplay is so messed up for an ARPG and hell even the audio mix is messed up!

Got it for 5$ and still feel scammed, there's way more than enough ARPG out there to want to play this mess of a game.

Not recommended at all.

After playing more: Definetly a bad and frustrating game because of 2 main reasons:
1)Janky combat that was never balanced, for example enemies with a shield are invulnerable to axe attacks and you have to perfect parry to destroy their shield but they do mostly strong attacks that can't be parried.
All attacks track you, all attacks are almost the same speed so if you miss an attack you can even get hit with a strong attack that is 50% of your hp.
2) I really dislike the main character, the main character is always edgy and frustrated. If the main character was a gamer you would tell them to go touch grass
The game is not bad if it was in 2015. It has it's charm but there are many issues with it. Since the price is not that high it's not such a bad deal but it's definetly one of those "console games" that was never optimised for pc so it looks sluggish and attacks use a lot of tracking.
PRO: zombies and trenches, the gunpowder guns feel good, combat is simple but decent with the option of geting a lot more complex later, it has a semi-dodge and a parry/block, magic skills, progression is pretty good.

Eneba,great prices for new or older games https://www.eneba.com/?af_id=Neyreyan Twitch:https://www.twitch.tv/neyreyantv i will try to stream Discord - games and the meaning of life:...

Gunpowder is replenished if you do melee attacks, magic reloads over time so combat can seem spectacular
CONS: Story is horrible, character are anoying, definetly a political lessons type of game, the character designs are stupid because they don't even have pouches with supplies for their guns. The UI and inventory management is too simplistic because of the console design
Game is horribly optimised for pc with some areas droping FPS like this is a 2024 mmo with 100 players in the area:)
Aparently you can change some graphic options to make it look better but it's still grey-ish looking and too clean looking. It will look bad no matter what you chose
Overall the negative review is because of the bad optimisation and lazy/political writing and character design. If the developers work more on the pc version and improve the animations i would change my review to positive

Can only play as a woman... in a game about using brute force to defeat opponents.

Stupidly immersion breaking when every fight is followed up with "yeah, right" when you smack an opponent across the room. Especially when they are at least double your size.

And that's in addition to the fact that for some reason you only get 3 shots with your flintlock pistol (that you don't actually reload), but is your primary source of interrupts and damage. Confusing mechanics choice there by the developers. So you're stuck using your axe for most of the damage which... as I mentioned is pathetically unbelievable when you're a tiny woman.

The levels all seem to be linear and basically disguised rooms with mobs waiting for you to fight them.

There's some kind of mechanic where you're basically gambling with your "reputation" which is garnered by killing mobs, but it disappears if you don't cash it in and get hit... again, kind of amusingly poor choice by the developers.

The usual tropes are there..
Red attacks means unblockable.
There's a block/parry skill just like every other game lately that only seems to work when it wants to.
The sprint key is rebound to CTRL for some reason and shift is your dodge instead of sprint.. no idea why.

Massive stuttering if you have a current-gen video card. You'll need to look up some articles on how to fix it and what to disable.

Oh, and... this whole adventure happens because you shot a gun at a forcefield... and broke it.... during a war... when people are shooting guns constantly.

Yeah, so much of this is garbage.

Game is super short. Story is rushed with no type of development. Combat is meh. RPG mechanics aren't implemented very good. $20-$30 seems like a fair price if u wanna try it out.

The game is finally out, and so it's time for my __!!!long awaited butt review!!!__.

A few years back when the game was announced, the trailed showed the main character (now Nor Vanek) sporting tight-fitting, yoga pants style leg wear that nicely accentuated her butt.

I'm sad to see that in the release version the pants have changed to a more loose fit that is not as stimulating. I don't actually think the quantity of butt has changed, but the quality certainly has.

I cannot abide by such a downgrade on good conscience, and will therefore downvote the game.

The only thing I can give this game a thumbs up for is the environment looks great and I guess the story.
The combat is saved by the pistol/magic because melee feels like garbage. Probably the worst looking armour I have ever seen in a game. I got more than half way done the game then lost interest.
