Just here to 5 star to balance out the sad 1 star losers who get triggered by a pronouns selector. Get a grip. 
It's a bit sacharin but it plays well, more traditional final fantasy (essentially job based) than pokemon. Good music and it's nice to see Godot in production.

A pleasant, fun game
A new, fun and delightful take on an old genre. Fans of Nexamon should enjoy this.  Another indie putting corporate devs to shame. This game is full of heart and story, I prefer it over the original Pokemon I grew up with in 2000. Absolutely love it, and I'm glad something decent, unbroken has arrived on GP. A gem in amidst the coal.

Great indie gem
Cassette Beasts certainly takes its roots and inspiration from Pok√©mon, but puts its own spin and original take on the genre. 
Starting at first, you may feel a bit unsure of the game, but give it time and there is most certainly a 'click moment'. Its fun, addictive and the music is amazing.
Ignore the review bombers as Cassette Beasts is great!

Unique Gameplay and amazing music
The music in this game is on another level, honestly listening to the albums while i work.
The gameplay is similar enough to other similar games to make it easy to pick up, but different enough that it feels super fresh. Probably better than most new Pokemon games (dont sue me nintendo). The way that types interact with each other is so smart, much better than just "water beats fire", instead "water douses fire so it decreases its attack/defence"
Highly recommend, a new and interesting poke-like, but its probably better.
(also ignore indie bombers, theyre just salty that a game made by 2 people is better than their most recent COD titles)

Really awesome game
Wouldn't say its anything like Pok√©mon, I don't think that comparison is fair. Clearly a lot of love went into this game. The battle system is really fleshed out and super interesting, and once you get the hang of it you can make some really neat tactical plays.
The story and characters are compelling and the game oozes this kind of sinister undertone which for me makes me really want to see where it goes.
Highly recommend, can't stop playing!

Not for me
I'm all for monster tamers on console, we need more of them so I respect the effort here to provide something unique but the whole cassette spin is just kinda weird and doesn't do it for me. It's also some what of an overcomplication of the genre. It just doesn't feel right. If you like monster tamers then definitely try it out for yourself but for me personally there's nothing that would make me play this over the 2 Nexomon games. I like the breeding concept CB offers but I couldn't enjoy the game long enough to actually experience it. All in all it's worth checking out yourself but it just seems weird and awkward to me.

Awesome game!
Review: If you like Pok√©mon but with a very odd twist of taking on the forms of said monsters then this will definitely appeal to you! It's a very odd game and I don't want to spoil any of it but man, it gets weird real quick and in the best way possible in my opinion. Definitely worth a look.
Fix for controller: Just to clear a thing up, it does have controller support. If you have issues with this, I'd suggest looking it up on Google as I can only post a few different fixes. The best one I can find is going into Steam, turn off Desktop Mode and then it should work. I know this sounds odd but that does help, even with non-Steam games. Secondly I'd suggest fully restarting the Xbox App and then try. Thirdly, you might need to restart your PC completely to get it to work. Hope this helps!

The game gives you an option to pick your pronouns and honestly couldn't give a f. Some of these 1 star reviews are more triggered than a extreme karen wanting people to call them their pronouns. Oh the irony... Whether a game has it or not it doesn't affect my experience and if it makes other people feel better in themselves then im all for it.

Its basically pokemon in the early years with a different name.

One of the best games of it's genre
I'm sure the devs are sick of pokemon comparisons by now but pokemon is synonymous with this genre of game so it's difficult to talk about without mentioning it, so i'm gonna do it anyway. This game is like if pokemon aged up with it's audience. It has some mature themes and can be quite difficult if you aren't thinking about team comp. The gen 5-esque art-style is entirely superior to the 3D model style Game Freak went in. The OST is brilliant too. The game is also very queer and every(human) party member you can recruit is romanceable so if you're upset when there is representation outside of cisheteronormativity like another reviewer and think the mere existence of queer people is "political", this probably isn't the game for you. I wish it was even more queer tbh! I wanna start a polycule with all my fave characters! But unfortunately if you want to romance all the characters, you have to do it behind each of their backs which feels a little gross. Overall though I adore this game!

Fun game, but the nitty gritty start to build up and they build up fast. Enemies summoning allies feels cheap, and it happens a lot. The overworld is lacking with a limited sprint to begin with, having to heal often because your health is not a generous amount. There's no good way to grind or level that doesn't involve fight, heal, fight, heal. If you don't you'll be gaining little exp and take even longer. Great concept, not executed as well as i'd hoped

As a longtime PKMN fan this is the only time a Pokemon-like has interested me proper and it's the only one I've tried that's actually any good. It's different enough gameplay-wise to be a fresh experience, but similar enough that if you like PKMN you'll like this one. Fun monster designs, love the gorgeous pixel artwork and the full artwork of the people. One thing I love the most about this is the different ways the elements affect each other, and how it adds an extra level of technique and challenge to the game. Not too difficult and not too easy.

Remix Of Pokemon
I couldn't get my 1 star rating out of the drawer fast enough. 
To my credit, being the gaming hero that I am, I gave the game a go. Just to see if this was the Pokemon that would finally show me why all those other Pokemons are so popular.  
Alas, it was not to be.
I played as far as completing the first fusion boss thing and it was dull, dull, dull. 
Haters of the 1 star slapdown may be pleased to know that a second star was almost earned! The ability to disable the woman's dreary singing without losing the background music made me so grateful that I loved the game for at least several seconds. In the end it wasn't enough for that extra star but it was definitely the standout moment.

Another one.
First, when you give your games out pratically free to millions of people, then you will see plenty of negative comments and scores as most of the people are outside that games demographic. Can't have your cake and eat it. As for the game, it's nothing special, lazy graphics and gameplay that has been copied and pasted for years. There might be something special in it but I am not likely to stick around long enough to find out. Also, being asked what pronouns you prefer is NOT something that should be allowed in games. Far to political and controversial. Won't stop me playing but it dropped a star for the cheek and assumption that it is something I agree with.
