Well made, but pace is glacial
Writing is the weakest part of otherwise solid game. Excruciatingly slow. Good to see it not relying heavily on the supernatural/mystical stuff, at least.

Alright
Tell Me Why was a Great game to play as it had quite a few Powerful Moments that really intrigued me throughout, the Soundtrack is Amazing as always (Dont Nod has never failed with this), the Environment also was Gorgeous, the Story though whilst taking awhile to Progress was Alright.
Chapter 1 was a Nice introduction to the Characters but, felt quite drawn out, I would be lying if I were to say I wasn't losing interest at an Exponential rate here, Chapter 2 shifts the pace by a lot as the Story starts to become more Interesting and Dire, this restored my interest and by Chapter 3, I was fully invested in the Story of Alyson & Tyler.
The Plot-twist was Great but the Ending whilst Good felt less Impactful in comparison to the Life Is Strange series, playing this Game made me crave for Life Is Strange, Overall, this Game was Alright, definitely worth a play, Thank you Dontnod and Xbox Studios for this game.

This game isn't life is strange. It's made by the same people, but it is NOT life is strange.
This is a slow narrative-driven decision based game. Its made the way it is. Please don't rate this game badly just cus "iTs sO sLoW"
if you go into this game expecting action and fast-paced story telling YOU WILL be disappointed. Utterly brilliant game for those who love a good story and characters with VERY important themes and discussions.

Good Game!
The game is very good, especially if you enjoy slower paced games like Life Is Strange. All the low ratings are from transphobes upset that the main character is a trans man and think its pushing it onto kids, even though the age rating is 16 and up. Very sad peoplee that need to get a life.

I'll tell you...
...it's worth a play! Excellent visuals, decent characters and a fair few discoveries make this game worth the handful of hours that it offers.
There's no real action here. The enjoyment lies solely with the story and point and click experience, with the odd puzzle thrown in now and again. Emotions run high, and woke issues are present too, which is worth bearing in mind if you find these things annoying. I found this gave the game its own unique story points to think about. The game is also glitch and bug free, in my experience. 
So for those who can appreciate a relaxed, story driven game - jump in and give it a try!

So this "game" is not really fun, there is nothing really you have to play. All you have to do is sit and watch, so this is like a movie made entirely in a game engine. 97% of the "game" is cutscenes, and that 3% where you need to move is frustratingly slow. God forbid is you click on the same dialog again, as you can't skip it so you have spend another few minutes listening to the same dialog again. Graphics are nice, the "game" looks modern, but gameplay is non existent.

I can't describe how utterly boring this game is. I love narrative-driven experiences, but this just feels fleshed out to make it more than it actually is. Try it on Game Pass for free and make up your own mind though.

On a technical level, it is pretty much bug-free. The minor complaint is if you press the interaction button while moving, the interaction is registered after you stop so you sometimes end up interacting with a different thing.

Superb Slow Burn Drama
Amazing writing, acting, sound design and ambient music, with stunning visuals.  Gameplay is limited to 3d point and click style exploration, light puzzles and the occasional simple mini game.  The strongly written and acted storyline develops largely through cutscenes and dialogue options which feel like they have some consequence.  I was gripped throughout, even if it had no interactivity the drama itself would hold its own.  Transgender character is crucial to the story: however, the twice occuring possible inter racial romance between a mixed race gay man and an female to male transgender person felt awkward and contrived.  The collectibles have some significance, so I was gutted that 1 areas design deprived me of the possibility to collect 1 item.  The story concludes in a really satisfying way with some stunning moments.  Tell Me Why is interactive narrative gameplay at a really high level of execution.  Recommended.

Paper Thin Filler
The idea of looking back at your memories seems interesting at first but in reality, it's just boring filer.  Constantly talking about the past and watching the past, it all just becomes a boring blur of dialog. Doesn't really add any mystery, doesn't add any consequences, the two twin tragic relationships among other characters, is so paper thin, I don't feel nor care for them.  The physic bond telepathic link is cool in theory but offers very little for the gamers to use as a tool or choice. Just more filler dialog.  The spooky sinister shadow is probably the only best thing but it is used so little and a little too late.  I've yet to warm up to Tyler, his voice still hasn't captured me, his tone on deliver of lines can be off and doesn't quite provoke a strong emotion.  It's a shame, could of been so much better but it misses the mark.

Good Story, Interesting Mechanics and Design
Incredible game that revolves around a brilliantly unique and thought-provoking story. Butterfly effect like Life is Strange or Wolf Among Us. Sorta supernatural and sort of a 'work out the mystery' game. The controls are good and the game specific mechanics are easy to get used to. Only criticisms are that there's no ability to run and that you can't skip conversation on second play-through - limits replay-ability despite the type of game.

Very well made
Beautiful game with a powerful story and some important subject matter.
Not quite 5 stars despite playing for all 3 endings. Some minor graphical anomalies, a couple of soft lock moments possibly related to one of the mini games or restoring from a suspended game, and some continuity issues with dialogue, especially in the 3rd chapter just let it down enough to not give full marks. Nothing that majorly affects an otherwise well written, heart warming and sometimes shocking story, albeit at a sometimes slower pace.
Such a shame we have to put with the absolute idiot sandwiches in the comments.

Heart-breaking, emotional story.
*Tell me why* is a beautiful, intense, and touching game, about a bond between two, separated twins, and their painful past. This game has stunning graphics, just like the *life is strange* franchise.
*Tell me why* handles difficult, and emotional topics like gender, family and mental health, in a respectful and realistic way. 5/5

great story
this is by far their best game. The writing is much better than life is strange 1 and 2, aswell as the gameplay elements. I like the fact that its only 3 chapters aswell because it means less filler nonsense and more straight to the point. my only complaint with this is the reading and the puzzles but they don't force you to do them which is good.

Game is adventure, walking simulator type. Narrative and voice acting is great. Graphics and environment look yummy. Sometimes I felt specific parts are just put in to make the game longer. mid-end of second part and middle part of third chapter. They made puzzles but they are so rare. Some choices are fake.(obviously) You could check out if you love the genre. 6/10

The whole game in general was breath taking and the storyline was genuinely amazing 10/10 best game I've played in ages.

Not the teams best work
Whilst Dontnod continue to impress with their creative and unique art style, and innovate in the genre with new gameplay elements (such as reading the diary to help solve puzzles and provide further backstory), I feel that the writing has taken a nosedive compared to Life is Strange 1 and 2. Strange responses to situations, sudden changes in characters attitude which make no sense... Things like that. A shame, because it had potential. Hopefully their next project will be better!

Tell Me Why is a visually beautiful game, like DONTNOD's games tend to be. It has enjoyable gameplay and an engaging story line.
The story is pretty good, it explores interesting themes and uses the memory and voice gimmick quite well. I didn't get bored of the story, and I was always interested in getting back into the game and playing more.
There are only a couple of endings in this game, and most of your choices will not affect the endings, but will affect your relationship with other characters. I like this choice system personally, but some may find it meaningless.

This game is a storytelling masterpiece.

beautiful game
In many ways, it feels more accurate to me to describe this piece of art as an "interactive mystery drama", as calling it an adventure does not adequately describe the experience. A moving and immersive story, touching and whilst containing an element of the fantastical, it is grounded enough in its depictions of characters and life that it is very realistic. Really enjoyed it

Could have been...not quite.
A * for acting and another for game design with some decent scenarios moving the story along. The story is let down by being ott woke at every opportunity. It isn't just that one of the main charecters it trans (charecter development for the twins is actually quite good) but almost everyone in the game who isn't woke are portrayed as ignorant neanderthols. Prepare for a massive cringe-athon as you have your open mind nailed shut by a story that can be quite compelling and, simultaneously embarrassing to whitness. Its not exactly preaching morals but does condescend to the player.

The story is good but nothing compared to the original Life is Strange, It seems with every iteration Of this franchise the crux of the magic element gets worse and worse, The time travel in the original made for exciting choices, and the recalling memories is ok but pretty bland.
Pros: Story
Cons: Tedious gameplay at times.

Only negative thing I have is some of the puzzles are quite tedious. Other than that, this was a nice ride. Story was engaging and had an interesting twist and had some relatable moments. Graphics are the usual when it comes to DONTNOD. Lovely scenery, good character animations. Lip syncing was slightly off at a few points, but it's not the end of the world. Can't say much for the soundtrack. There were a couple of tracks that spooked me like searching in the archives in chapter 2 and just before the final choice in chapter 3. The power to telecommunicate was interesting but didn't really do much as its usually mandatory to progress. Being able to see memories and using it as a way to drive Alyson n sane was quite interesting. Wouldn't bother reading most reviews on here when a good number of them are transphobic.

Slow burner, but good plot and characters
You can definitely tell this game was inspired by life is strange, the twins have a special ability like something out of that series. I still loved this game however espically chapters 2 & 3 where the story started to pick up pace and had more focus on the characters. Chapter on the other was too uneventful & forgetable for me, apart from the cliffhanger at the end of the chapter which was really good. I also noticed that the facial animations didn't have enough emotion and there were some janky controls. On the other hand chapter 2 & 3 were reallly good and had a more interesting direction as you try and uncover the main mystery, plus there is some really good character direction, not only that but the game was a chill experience at times. I also liked the attention to detail which certain parts of the game more immersive & realistic. Overall great game, but chapter was a let down.

I love this game now!
I originally played back when it was released on gamepass a few years back. Didnt really enjoy it! But now im loving it... 
This game isn't for people who dont like story point and click games, E.G; Life Is Strange! Also not for snowflakes who cant get over the fact there is a trans main character... 
NOW i will say the story drags on a bit, but most story driven games like this usually do drag on! So if you arent willing to put 2-3 hours in for the first chapter this isnt the game for you, So ill save you the time playing to then put a negative review on it just for the games pacing taking awhile!
Im only on the first chapter as of now an there are already so many twists and turns  in my opinion.
The game and all of its chapters are free during pride month so why not give it a go? I mean you dont have to spend anything, whats the worst that could happen?
Im going to continue playing this, if anyting changes ill keep this revew up to date! 
Happy pride 2024... Hope everyone's great <3

Loads of reviews here make out like this is the best game that has ever been made, but honestly it's lacklustre at best. It's so slow moving that it's painful to get through. The graphics are pretty good, but for a story that's supposed to be so emotional, the characters show zero emotion and the voice acting does little to rescue this. I even stopped playing for a couple of months and came back to give it a second chance. I just couldn't get into it.

I enjoyed it, most reviws are bigoted time bombers. Simular to LIS - not entirely, but a simular vibe. Choice making and some objectives are fun. Didnt enjoy the puzzles as they felt out of place. Others, a good enjoyable game for FREE.

The representation I've been aching for and the storyline and mystery are just chef's kiss imo. It doesn't feel like the game manipulating you into making specific decisions either. It's a little slow paced at the beginning but is definitely worth it in order to get deeper into the story line. :)

Amazing story
Well  a fan of story driven adventures this one really pulled the heart strings and kept me engaged. As a gamer with many games it took a little under a year to complete this due to family commitments, work and playing too many games but the time I spent with this game was a s pleasure. It covers so many topics so those sensitive to many issues might find it hard to play but its so well written, acted and voiced. The lead character are amazing and your really care for them and engage in the story. Its sad in places but that's what the game is about. A must play for any fans who like quick time events, story rich narrative with beautiful scenic locations and plot. A must play

Life's still strange
Just came back to this game after a break and found I enjoyed it more my second time around, a tragic well told story worth seeing through to the end. If you've played any of their games before you should know what you're in for, great voice acting, great characters (love them or hate them), and a great story. While definitely slower in pace, it plays we with the slowly unravelling mystery leading to one of two satisfying conclusions.

Can seem a tad slow at times, however the plot is amazing, and the characters are done justice through their personalities.

You really feel the struggles for everyone, and it becomes such a wirlwind of emotion. Puzzles are fun too!

Tell Me Why Indeed
Discussion around this game is pretty toxic. For me the DontNod style of games have gradually decreased in quality since the first LiS although True Colours was quite good. What I think is missing here is that previous games dropped you in contexts such as high-school or moving to a new place. Those are relatable for most people. Tell Me Why takes a very specific route that few people will understand or appreciate. It almost feels like it's trying too hard at the same time. Like, being trans can be very hard but (SPOILERS) the mental health and attempted murder aspects felt a bit too far removed for me. Previously we had the murder of Rachel Amber which was pretty far-fetched but at least the context of the overall game was relatable. I applaud DontNod for giving trans issues some exposure and fair treatment, but at the same time they may have inadvertently upheld stereotypes whilst stagnating their own game formula.

Personally, I think this is one of the best games I have ever played. I have never seen a game with such an impelling and emotional storyline. When i was playing the game, it is so well done that I felt like I was there. I played this game with my dad and he enjoyed this game a lot aswell, showing this game is amazing for all ages. Although, it does have quite a lot of explicit language and players might find some bits distressing. Overall, I think Tell Me Why is one of the best storyline games I have ever seen and I highly recommend it to everyone, especially if you have played Life Is Strange, since it is made by the same people.

I think that the game is great and that the long and drawn out scenes are as normal with other choose games such as TWD and LIS. Also i think that it doesnt matter wether you are straight or LGBTQ everone can enjoy it. Finally i think that it creates a nice twist with the memory recall segments as it shows the bond between Tyler and Alyson and how they use it to discover the truth . Overal i think it has some work like the sometimes out of sinc mouths and the some what high price but it is usual for choice game chapters and i got it with the free deal so no complaint on that and my verdict is that it is worth it for the good storyline alone and that it should not be gaining so much dislike.

Last review was reported had some random messaging me from a burner account trying to bait me.This game pales in comparison to life is strange 2 (the only reason i gave this game a chance) the characters were/are forgettable the story is forgettable the only thing i actually remember are the number puzzles from the book.The female character was...i don't even have words to describe my lack of empathy towards her and the other female character was an annoying üí© that i wanted to die just for being whiny. Now report that if you want,i know exactly how i phrased what i said (ragebait).

Very slow and idicative of many current developers.
Yet another well intentioned game missing what inclusive actually means. Going to great lengths to show trans people as different. Not deserving of a strong lead role without having to focus on them being trans. We're all just people with our own differences. This is not inclusivity, it is exclusivity.

Probably the most boring game ive ever played
The only good thing about this game is that u get a decent amount of gamerscore by just completing it. And that is the only reason i havent given it 1 star. It is so unbelievably boring and the story is so ****, literally nothing that interesting happens. DO NOT BUY.

I Highly Recommend It But I Do Think It Could Have Been A Longer Game. Overall, Its A 10/10 Game And I Love It So Much. Keep Up The Great Work.

If you enjoyed Life is Strange you'll feel at home. However I felt chapter 3 to have a really slow and lacking beginning, the ending was compelling and good overall.

This game is something else...
Ths games storyline hit differnt. Yes it was very strict yet it gave you so many differnt outcomes. It dosn't drag along and some of the few puzzles are do-able. Overall in my opinion this game is very emotional.

Not the most 'active' game but a really great story. Not too drawn out either with a couple of nicely thought out puzzles involving stories from their past. I look forward to more in the future from the same people.

Amazing writing and acting
The most believable characters I've ever seen, even the potential antagonists. Choices are few, but do matter and rarely have the "No I didn't want to say that": characters behave in a very satisfying way.
Technically also a major step up from the previous games of Dontnod, with beautiful vistas which you enjoy your time looking and avoiding slow overlong walks which don't advance the story.

Got most of the way to the end then stopped playing nothing compared to LIS 2.Maybe that's because i have a younger brother idk? No touching moments (mushrooms death üò•) or character connection whatsoever Tyler is a whiny **** and the girl was just boring af.What was with the wannabe homo boyfriend too?All people that age these days bent and pretending not to be?

Well made, but pace is glacial
Writing is the weakest part of otherwise solid game. Excruciatingly slow. Good to see it not relying heavily on the supernatural/mystical stuff, at least.

I like these story type game but i found myself getting bored with this and only playing for the achievements.I installed episode 3 on day one of release and its took me till now to be bother to play it just so im able to delete it and make some space and not keep seeing it on my new xbox. The game story was ok and the end plot twist was good but i called it half way through,The puzzle part got annoying quickle but if you looking easy gamerscore and a chilled out game id recommend this

Beautifully made game, interesting story, 1st Class graphics full of lovely scenery. But why does the sister have to be transgenda, why not leave this WOKENESS out and just kept him as her brother. We have enough of this brain washing normality exceptance rammed down our throats in the real world, we play games to escape it.sorry but if it wasn't for this I'd have easly given it five stars.

If you loved the Life is strange series then this is the game for you. Or if you're looking for a new genre of game to play, id highly suggest playing this. Each episode is 3 hours long roughly, so thats 9-10 hours, the story is emotionally driven, catching your attengion with all the twists until the truth finaly comes out...
