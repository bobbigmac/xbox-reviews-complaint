Pretty good
No idea what game those reviewers played, but this is good fun, a little bit jank but it's at least as good as The Surge or Darksiders 3, a little better than Thymesia or Mortal Shell, but not as good as Lies of P. Performance is good and no idea why everyone says protagonist is unlikeable, she's a standard fantasy stoic protagonist, there's not enough personality to dislike. The combat is crunchy, exploration is decent, level design is good and you can play with push combat. The parry windows are massive, making this a fairly easy soulslike, but does have some challenging boss fights that checkpoint between phases. I really enjoyed it, confused by these massively upvoted negative reviews that can't have played the same game.

Guide an unlikable protaganist through the gloomy graphics from one clumsy combat encounter to the next. Take on the twin evil gods of Clunk and Jank, many times over, and just pray there's enough copium in the world to get you through it. This game makes Immortals Of Aveum look good. 
As an added bonus, selecting the Story difficulty disables all Achievements so those looking for a "chill game" should know there's a compromise for enjoying the game that way.

My experience so far. (Completed the story)
The game started slow and weird tbh but i've been playing a little bit and it's grown on me, Parry timings are pretty similar to Lies of P, i think i'll probably play it to the end, i'd recommend giving it a go... I think the other reviews are a bit unhinged.
After completing the story I will say that it gets better and better as you play but it's a bit Meh at the start and then improves, I had a fun time playing, hopefully they make a sequel to explore "the world below". Feel free to send me hatemail folks, i'm just judging it for what it is.
P.s Alot of 1 star reviewers have less than 10 minutes playtime.

Doesn't have an identity
Okay so the game isn't that bad as reviews say their is fun to be had here, but the issue lies in the gameplay. If they had made it a hack n slash it would be good and if it was a dark souls game it would be good. The problem is the devs have tried to mesh the 2 together and not done a great job with it. The enemies aren't interesting, dialogue isn't great, skill tree is meh. I tried on hard and all enemies do is red attack and have shields up it was frustrating/boring. The combat can be confusing with the double jumping and evading as your not sure whats is best. Theirs a multiplier which does not belong in the game with enemies doing attacks that can't be predicted at times or evaded or blocked iys really daft. Games worth £15 to just stick on easy and play for gamerscore just to have fun with. I don't like bashing on games too much but this game has an identity crisis.

avoid until patched
Tried on two PCs well over the recommend specs and performance is an unacceptable mess. No shader pre compilation and constant traversal stutter makes the precision the game requires feel awful. 
The sound mix is bafflingly bad as well. Dialogue is muddy and not balanced meaning subtitles is an absolute must if you care about the story.
Very disappointed with the state of this release as I was looking forward to what looked like an interesting take on the souls genre. The Art style of the game is pretty great and I thought the setting felt pretty fresh but until performance is fixed I'd say there's no reason to try this unless the console versions fair better.

Need I say more?
Alright I will. The developers themselves are not the problem, its SBI and companies like them that are the problem. They take a game that can have so much potential and hollow it out so they can add a main character that has no personality besides their skin colour and their identity. Its cheap, it does a disservice to the developers because THEY are the ones putting in the work, SBI just looks at it, shrugs and insists on checking boxes, whether it benefits the games' narrative or not. Make the story gripping, edge of your seat stuff. Make the combat engaging and fun. We as the players can create a character that fits US, the player, the individual. This game still has potential, but identity politics gets in the way of riveting storytelling.

Only so far in, but it's not really gripping me story wise. Just kind of starts without much info. and it's not a very captivating or well told story. Just a bit bland. Combat wise, I found it was fairly fun if you like a souls style game. It worked well with the skills you can add to increase attacking and mobility capabilities, blocking and parrying felt poor though. Not bad, not great.

I really liked the game vibe and fliyin trough sky with portals, but so many things like battles coud have been handled better. Most of the time overall game sound overpovered dialogs and other character voices except the main characters voice. Main characters story seemed a bit shallow and missing something. Also not alloving achievements in story mode rises questions of why. Seems like by wanting more chill game you are being punished for that by getting less than others.

Pretty mid
DEI review bombing aside, the game is pretty mid. Bad writing - the usual modern media overexposition and 'arrogant and abrasive' = 'strong and confident' BS - and awful sound mixing/direction make it clear the VAs are alone in a soundproof booth reading off lines with minimal context, resulting in stiff dialogue forever out of place. Some interesting aesthetics all mashed together into a discordant mess leaves much to be desired visually too.
Combat/exploration is more GoW than Soulslike and is serviceable enough but bland. Goes from easy mobs with obnoxious tracking to just obnoxious bosses - Normal difficulty. People mentioning Fable are just flat wrong. Never got far game crashed x2 - Series X. SBI are vultures 100% but so are half these reviews ngl - no criticism for devs, just backend politics vs a small group of industry opportunists that, while valid to hate, dont deserve review bombing these devs over. Wouldnt buy this though, its a big ask outside of GP.

Started the game and was in the early stages of marvelling at how janky the movement is and failing to get the camera to do what I want, when I actually met a progress blocking glitch in the freaking tutorial. An enemy I had to kill got stuck in some scenery, couldn't move and couldn't be killed. I'm usually very forgiving of bugs but I already knew, in those first minutes, that the game was going to be punishing in all the wrong ways. Uninstalled, rather than reloading, even on GP.

Fully finished the game, side missions and liberated strongholds. I found the combat and exploration rewarding for the first few hours but it quickly became stale. The two characters are great, well acted and the dialogue while exploring the open world made the tedios traversal worh while. This game screaming out for a mount or some sort of other method of getting around the large, empty areas. 
NPC's feel lifeless and unintersting and a times pointelss with the majority of voiced NPC's simply existing to upgrade gear.
The boss fights feel fun and fresh from the main combat but ultimately on the highest difficulty feel very easy.
Overall it's a fun game. If you enjoyed the combat of the newer God Of War of Star Wars Jedi games I'd recommend it. If you are looking for a "Souls like" or "Souls lite" just play lies of P.

Okay. So I've just finished the game. Got about a day's playtime. This game was good. I don't know where y'all are getting the 1* from. The story was great, tied together very well, especially at the end, a woman giving her last bit of her love, to her beloved was a seriously beautiful touch. The combat is fun and fluid once you get upgraded. Minor audio bugs, but experienced nothing major. Nothing game breaking. This was a good game. The flags were a d*ck, and some of the enemies towards end game were very frustrating, wizard ball chucking pieces of sh*t. But nonetheless I enjoyed it. So if you want a soulslite that's good fun, and isn't too difficult, give this a play. You might be surprised. It's a 4* game and above. Anything below that is nonsense. SBI was barely noticable, or do ya'll think creating a game with a black protagonist is a forced issue. That's not DEI btw, you clearly didn't give the game a chance, and honestly you missed out

Based on experience
So this game like many others in the franchise is meant to be a souls like game which is, now for those hating on the game for no reason have probably played other soul like games the same is the same in my case I have played Lord of the Fallen from 2014 and Lies of P. Now as someone that gets angry/annoyed quite easily when it comes to soul like games this is probably the better of the them for new players to get into the franchise, I have put 18 hours into the game so far and have 1 boss left and a total of 10 achievements left to get and I will probably 100% the game.
The only issues I have had in terms of gameplay is the parrying which I'm not a fan of due to having to hold the button instead of tapping it like most souls games which can't be changed in the settings and getting hit in combat even though you dodged the attack the blade somehow hits you. Now if these were fixed/able to changed them I would give it a 5 star because I had a overall good experience so far.

It's decent & I don't understand the hate
Probably too easy for veteran souls players although I just played it on normal. I found the story & characters bland & generic though but really that was my main gripe with this and I am not even into these kind of games. I would recommend to most players to try for themselves though as while not perfect, it's a decent effort from a small studio. Not sure why it's getting so much hate although I have to agree the story, characters & writing are subpar at best but I genuinely don't think it's as bad as many are making it out to be. Also most seem to ignore the fact it's from a fairly small studio & it's obviously not going to be as polished as a Fromsoft game but that's just my opinion.

Decent Soulslite
Not perfect but doesn't deserve the shallow 1 star reviews. Decent spin on souls combat, took a while to get into the groove with it with parry timings that sometimes feel a little unforgiving. Nice linear story with light exploration that didn't outstay its welcome. Not for everyone but if you like souls games and want to try something a little different with a little more action, it's worth a shot! I enjoyed it throughtout.

Fun game
Ignore the bigoted review bombers, this is a fun game and very much in line with the professional critics review consensus in my experience.  Fun satisfying combat, great mix of steel, guns and magic, good traversal through the great looking environments and decent quests.  
Unlike some games which suffer from an over abundance of quest and loot elements, this game is pleasantly restrained which makes what you do get all the more rewarding.
Runs like a dream as well 120fps 4k max settings (DLSS 3.5) so not sure why some are complaining about optimisation (maybe just poor rigs).  One of the better running PC games I've seen this year.
Well recommended.

Not A Bad Game... 😀
4 Stars because there's No Achievements for playing it in Story Mode. Which is unfair to genuinely disabled people, i myself have resently had a Stroke, & therefore find it hard to keep up with things going to fast.
The Game has good graphics on Xbox X, & good sound effects, can't comment on the music because that's the first thing i turn off, in all games.
Can get a bit confusing up front, as throws lots of things at you, in a very short space of time. Can be a bit hard on normal, i'm struggling a bit to be honest. A lot of the enemys blend into the background, & are hard to see, especially when there's more than one around, or if they have a gun.
Anybody else out there that has survived a Stroke, don't be afraid to say Hello. Time waisters can go F themselves... 🤔

I like this game...and yet
It's poorly optimised, cpu and gpu fans are just howling at me, I do like this game, I've had trouble souls-likes or Dark souls or Elden ring I just can't get into them even after buying them, however, the game plays a lot more like Darksiders with a dash of souls-like included which I did enjoy, it's just hard to ignore my pc's hardware moaning that the game pushing way harder than it should be. I like the story even though it's a tad flat, the undead horde element and the unleashed gods feels... a bit tacked on, quite a high number of enemy npcs' out in the wild can be completely side stepped/ignored unless there's an instance when you have to fight them, Nor's standard attack is all heavy hits, so exposure to being punished is very high, parry payoffs are worth the work and yet the punish is always fatal...hmmm I'll give another some other time when the game's fully optimised.

Dark Souls for people that don't like that style
Must admit I am fed up of all the Dark Souls like games these days. So many do the save at a bonfire and enemy respawn thing making the games so repetitive to play in my opinion. Flintlock manages to spice up the formula with slightly less aggressive difficulty spikes and a less scary world to explore. Not many enemies hiding in doorways and such.
The combat wants you to get good at parrying but you do not need to if you want to jump around like a scolded flee then you can. No stamina bar means you can do just that. 
The story is nothing special seemingly taking bits from many mythologies and smashing them together. Same goes for the world you are fighting in. There are giant birds used like horses similar to Final Fantasy games Chocobos and the medieval/nineteeth century time period thjough odd works well.
A good game overall 7/10 from me.

Dull
A mix of melee, guns and magic sounded interesting, but the combat in this game is pretty boring. The movement is very floaty. The characters are fairly uninteresting. The final battle is dumb, the camera can't keep up with the fight, you end up spamming slash, and hoping you hit something. Your  early game weapons are better than 90% of anything you'll find, so just speedrun the main missions. And no NG+ so don't bother grinding XP levels either.

Excelente juego AA
El combate es satisfactorio y no repetitivo, la exploración siempre es recompensada, te dan, en mi opinión, una de las mejores formas de movimiento que he visto, muy responsiva y divertida de usar. Logra un muy buen balance de mundo abierto pero a la vez no tanto que te sentís abrumado.
La historia y los personajes se sienten bastante bien escritos y los actores de voz (al menos en inglés) son excelentes.
Siento que es un juego que respeta tu tiempo, no vas a dedicarle docenas y docenas de horas, pero tampoco sentís que te estas perdiendo de algo por no hacerlo. Si exploras los niveles conseguís todo lo que podrías necesitar para seguir mejorando tu personaje, en ningún momento te ves realmente en la necesidad de grindear mobs porque te sentís underlevel.
En general una excelente experiencia, y espero que el desarrollador continúe la historia dado que el final es bastante abierto como para un DLC o una segunda entrega, la cual sin dudas jugaré!

Had potential, let down by mechanics.
It's obvious this game tries to be a more lenient, noob friendly Souls game. Which is fine, however the mechanics are just awful, the parry feels slow and unresponsive. 
You either parry to fast, or to slow. The enemies attack could be colliding directly with the player and the parry won't register 95% of the time. 
The animations are really bad, put it this way... I went back to Suicide Squad and found that game more enjoyable.

Fantastic Indie Adventure with some glaring Flaws
Firstly, deactivate HDR in your console settings. The white balance is completely off regardless of how you set the brightness. Wait for a patch to fix this....   
With that out of the way, what we have here is an outstanding Indie Souls-Lite with a more action oriented combat system that favours mobility and special skills along with perfect parries and firearms. Platforming and traversal, while a little bit floaty, really opens up the more you play with some very vertical sections. Performance and graphics are really good for a game under 20gb, voice acting is mostly decent with a few NPCs stand out as great, and a few that are not so great 😅. As you play you gain more followers at your camp which opens up more side quests and equipment upgrades. Loot system is a bit of a let down as one of the upgrade materials needed is this games equivalent of "Souls", limiting your experimentation. A Solid 7/10, but giving 5✨to counterbalance the review-bomb babies.

The combat felt good, except parrying which felt a little hit and miss. The variety of weapons and abilities kept things feeling fresh and interesting throughout. Also enjoyed zipping around using the rifts. 

The downside for me was it became repetitive. Having to do the same things, just in different parts of the map made it feel like a chore. Story could be improved

Racism much?
Ignore the thinly vieled racism that punctuates most of the reviews on here and you may enjoy a decent souls game with platforming and traversal elements. Very fun to play melee firearm infusion with great scale to environments and decent animations accross the board. The story is well told and acted but very generic. Don't go expecting shakespear and its a fun ride with likeable characters.

I like this game so far, but..
I like this game i enjoy the relationship between enki and nor. The world is unique and the character design is some of the best ive seen Nor and enki are beautiful but the real star design are the coffe shop hosts. However, there are issues the combat can SOMETIMES feel slow and unrewarding, perhaps its due to me being on the highest difficulty. Im not sure. I also wish there was just more background music as u journey through Dawn. A lot of people are leaving negative reviews solely on the race and gender of our protag and to those people i say HOLD THAT L NERD DEI IS HERE TO STAY. You dont like it? Make ur own gaming studio.

Great game ignore the moaners
Ive just gone to the 2nd map area and this game is very good, however it has visual issue that it is way to dark, even in the day u dan be blind down an alley where u get hit lossing your bonus as they are just not visible. I have gamma way way up and on my sammy Qled 4k 75".
UPDATE: They must of patched it i can now see in darker areas, and as a result i have now 1000 pointed this and really enjoyed it as its an exception game, i really enjoyed it, it was not difficult and later onin game your a beast killing bosses 1st try.
Give it proper go or u will be missing out on a great game, the devs did a good job and had their hand forced with main character, but look past the main character, yes shes there to tick boxes and its tiresome but dont let that stop u enjoying a top game, this could be fixed so easily with character creation allowing the player to be what ever gender, race, build they want to be, and thats far more inclusive than forcing it on players as many reviews here prove.

It sure beats walking! Give it a chance.
Flintlock is an interesting entry into the 'souls-like' genre. The combat is weighty and doesn't always hit the mark but is immensely satisfying at select times. The story and world is lacking in some areas but makes up for it in some way with the two main characters forming a bond that is certainly tested as the game progresses. I thoroughly enjoyed exploring the world with the rift travel system implemented and often found the dialogue and voice acting to be decent if not annoying sometimes. If you're a fan of Ashen this a solid entry in the universe of similar games, it brings it's own unique charm in its clunkiness and well worth playing given the GP offer. It is not without it's flaws but if you can look past these you'll find a decent game worth trying - Sure beats walking..

Positives: 
Game has great combat system. Parry, counter shot and criticals are very satisfying.
Movement is quick and fun makes exploration enjoyable. 
Loved all the boss fights with the exception of the final boss which coud've done with zooming out a tad.
Negatives: 
Not enough upgrade materials, the ability to purchase or farm them would fix this.
Tutorial was kinda lenghy and very hand holdy, almost put me off.
The mini game wasn't alot of fun and I didn't engage with it beyond getting the achievment for it.
All in all an excellent experience. It sadens me to see all the negativity.

Way better than most reviews would lead you to believe
I absolutely believe every one who has gave this a bad review hasnt put even an hour into the game, short attention spans, if you want the good good combat, weapons, abilities, story etc you need to be patient and put in a couple hours and explore. I will admit at the start of the game it feels very basic but the game takes it slow before its shows its full potential, i wasnt too impressed at the start but about 2 hours after the prologue the game started to really open it self up, the combat became way more intense and complex the abilities became very fun the world and map became detailed and intriguing to explore the progression felt rewarding, im about 5 hours in and im now hooked, if you dont give it a couple hours to ease you in then your not experiencing the real game, the combat from the start is nothing like the combat im experiencing now a few hours later, any one who has gave a bad review i guarantee hasnt spent over an hour on the game, THE PROLOGUE IS NOTHING LIKE THE GAME

I don't understand the crappy reviews
Skip to the end for the short version.
I liked this game a ton, there are a few issues with crashing but it's nothing that will get you redoing quest stuff the game saves constantly. The combat I thought was solid, even if Enki's magic is a bit overpowered. I did play the game on the standard difficultly yet it still provided challenging fights in a few places. The ending left me wanting more, maybe to add a DLC in the future, the final boss was way too easy, I found all the others much harder, may need some balancing. Some of the enemy types are complete BS, ruining a nice chunk on reputation bonuses quite a few times. I wish there was more gods to kill.
 8/10, has a few bugs, rebalance the final boss, not enough gods to kill.

Well, I've actually played it. [Unlike some]
Flintlock is a "souls-like" but it's really not too hard from what I've see. Graphically, I've not been impressed thus far. The combat is fairly slick if nothing to write home about. There's too much hand-holding with the tutorials however, meaning you HAVE TO do as they say to get past tutorial encounters. [which sucks]
As for the story, so far it seems to be about the decimation of our species, oh, and the protagonist did something stupid which allowed the "big bad" to manifest in the world. Talking of said protagonist, angry seems to be the primary theme. 
As to the one star reviews and the OBVIOUS review bombing this game has so far got, I feel that's unjustified. I haven't played this enough to rate it high or low, so, for now, a 3 will suit. And for the record, to the no play 1 star review hacks, I don't think "sweet baby inc" have poisoned this one. [So get over yourselves] It would be like playing as Franklin in GTA5 and having issues being a black protagonist...

Nor turns sideways for some reason and you have to adjust, often resulting in a miss. I enjoyed what I played however and it's definitely worth a try on Gamepass.

Very good action adventure game
I ended up really liking this. It was a bit shaky in the beginning and the combat felt way too floaty to be a souls-like. But when you start getting some abilities including the rift travel then it all sort off starts coming together. The game is more of an action adventure (like God of War) than a Souls-like in my mind anyway but that does not make much difference. Just don't expect a FromSoft type game. I did like the story and I thought the voice acting especially was excellent. There was some issues starting the game and I had to exit DSX (or set it to native mode) to get the game to work and perform okay. There was the occasional stutter etc. but nothing like some people on Game Pass have put in their reviews. So anyway, in summary, a really solid action game that is well worth your time.

Playable. Unique rewarding battle and progression, great world building and weapon designs. However the AI for enemies especially bosses, in particular Uru, are laughable ridiculous.

The game plays great, loved the combat mechanics though struggled at the start, but as you unlock more abilities and weapons you get a good synergy with attacks stacking. Level design is great with lots to explore off the main quest path. loved the character design of the Gods and the different environments and maps you travel through. not a massive variety in enemies but allows you to learn their attacks. Honestly one of the best games I've played in a while. Fully completed everything in 15 hours, couldn't ask for anything more.

It's not that I do not like the game, the concept & the mechanics are great BUT the whole thing just feels...empty. Everything worked for me, contrary to what other reviews will tell you. However, it was poorly written dialog although good voice acting or great visuals but all without the WOW moment. So, it comes across as a bit, well! Stale.
I think the game has bags of potential but with so many other great games to play, this one, I just won't play because I would rather play something else first - and that sums up the game perfectly for me.

games running on my 3090 at over 90fps on balanced dlss and its not a bad game so far. a lot easier then souls games so the guy complaining he cant get his achievements should cry more. graphics and sound are decent and game play is repetitive but isn't every game. negatives so far - story seems random and doesn't make sense.. I can kill a god, lose to a doggo god and then team up and threaten it with an axe after getting wrecked...odd.
stuttering seems to be from shaders imo. if it pre built the shaders I think it wouldn't struggle as much in new areas and would be a lot less noticeable. using freesync 120hz and its smooth otherwise

So far so good.
People are comparing this to a Souls game, sure, it has souls like elements with a dropped 'XP' mechanic and bonfires/sites of grace system, but its very light on all other souls-like aspects. Honestly, at the moment it's more like the newer God of War games. I may update my review after some more time but for now; I'm intrigued and excited to get more into it, and I hope there's more fun abilities that can set the game apart from it's inspiration. 
Few hours in and I do have some issues; clunky "parkour", unfair enemies, and the classic souls 'run-back' is just out dated. I'll push on though.

Pretty average
Not surprised to see the gamergate basement-dwellers review bombing and throwing a fit.
As the title states, the game is a rather average entry in the genre. I found the combat to be on the clunky side, and the only reason it could be challenging is because it doesn't work particularly well. The block and dodge felt very weak.
The world and character designs are nice, but the graphics are not what you would expect for a Series X/S game. It looks like a mid-tier Xbox One game. 
The devs have obviously tried to give us a 'Strong and Competent' protagonist, but have instead delivered 'Arrogant and Kinda Annoying'. Which is a shame, because that was what made me give up on the game.
If you havent already played it, the Dark Souls series would probably be a better purchase than this game

Solid, few hours of fun
Worth playing on game pass but probably not otherwise. The bosses are fun and rewarding, and there are some cool mechanics. Main issue is with pacing.. 75% of the game is CH1, and the next two chapters feel like a boss rush
Overall a very 7/10 game that does what it should, but no more

Some souls mechanics with a twist, its well made, somewhat challenging and rather unusual at times. But not one of those that will be played over and over

Easy souls like
Really good fun souls like mixed with elements of jedi survivor and AC origins. Cool story with good fighting mechanics but some challenging boss fights. All in all a really good game if you like souls games, RPG but need something a bit easier. For me 7.5/10

Another UE5 Cash Grab
Remnant, From the Ashes was the equivalent to a gate way drug for game studios to produce games like this. This game feels like someone created it in Fortnite in their creative mode or whatever it is called. Oh wait this game was made in UE5 so essentially it is just Fortnite. Another souls-like they tried to market as not a souls-like but played like a souls game? Lets not stop at the gameplay alone, the writing and character design seems "Soul-less" in short and felt like a chore to play in long. Not sure what the goal with this IP was other than a "Hey UE5 looks good right? RIGHT?" With all that being said UE5 is not a bad engine in the slightest with some games being absolutely amazing in engine. I would argue is the most consumer friendly one on the market be it that its FREE, but not everyone should have the tools to make games such as this. This makes me scared for the MGS 3 remake and every other remake and indie game getting cranked out through UE5. Kudos to Epic though!

Don't listen to the 1* reviews, yes the game has flaws, but its still rather fun and has a decent challenge. Well worth trying if you have gamepass.

Pretty good
No idea what game those reviewers played, but this is good fun, a little bit jank but it's at least as good as The Surge or Darksiders 3, a little better than Thymesia or Mortal Shell, but not as good as Lies of P. Performance is good and no idea why everyone says protagonist is unlikeable, she's a standard fantasy stoic protagonist, there's not enough personality to dislike. The combat is crunchy, exploration is decent, level design is good and you can play with push combat. The parry windows are massive, making this a fairly easy soulslike, but does have some challenging boss fights that checkpoint between phases. I really enjoyed it, confused by these massively upvoted negative reviews that can't have played the same game.

Didn't even play the game. Just here for the End of 'WOKE' BS in games we want story, we want good characters that feel really and live up to their role no matter the gender or race, because focusing on a gender because you hate the other so much, that's called sexism, something you clamed you aren't, focusing on a type of race killing monsters that apparently represent white people and colonialists (who btw are dead and gone so get over it) is racist.
This 'Game' is Racist. 
This 'Game' is Sexist.
This Shows us all that you care more about spouting you're views and shoving it in peoples faces rather than just making a good game.
Down with DEI 
Down with SBI
Lets make games good again, and god damn, it'll be me that does it if I need to, we are sick of this.
You may have infected the AAA studios but we the majority will start our own and trust me. we don't need you . we don't want you.
You'll be seeing me soon with true equality where the qualified and talented stand with dignity.

Really enjoying game so far. Was a bit clunky but toned FPS down and motion blur off which helped. 
Game play is good though so I plan to keep playing regardless.

Not the worst Soulslike I've ever played, combat is fine and hamlet system is novel enough. Wasn't expecting double and triple jumping...I don't love it but it's different at least.
Protagonist is fine as long as you can handle them not being a straight white male...if you can't then may your bum remain flustered.
