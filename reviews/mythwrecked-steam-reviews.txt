Storyline is uninspired and numbing at best. The interpretation of every single one of these gods is dumbed down to the point where I'd absolutely believe this is a game made for children.

Starting off with Hera, she's essentially just Zeus' sidepiece! Her entire station as Queen of the gods, goddess of marriage, and a woman who definitely does more than lightly scold her husband- has been simply TOSSED aside! The fact that she was reduced to such a pathetic roll is heartbreaking.

Athena is the god of wisdom, sure, but she's also the god of warfare. She's not some shut in nerd who focuses on books. She's a goddess of advancement that strives to build and improve upon everything.

Hephaestus is the god of the forge and yet he's almost ENTIRELY lacking in the protection that comes with forgework??? Infact he's one of the most clothes-lacking designs of the entire cast!

Aphrodite being chubby and focusing on all different kinds of love is the only positive note in this list. I do believe Aphrodite would have equal passion in finding every type of love, but she's still the goddess of beauty, lust, pleasure, and plenty more that could've rounded her out into something more than a flirty goddess who plays matchmaker.

All in all, this game was disappointing. At the price it's listed, it's entirely insulting. The shoddy camera-work prevents you from enjoying what could be a beautiful island, never letting you see more than a fraction at a time. The character models are abhorrent; re-using the same 5 facial expressions and voice lines grows tiresome VERY fast.

TLDR; Please don't buy this game. Buy Hades or God of War or any number of any other game that focuses on Greek Mythology. It'll be worth both your time and money.

Developed by narcissist Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou, Mythwrecked is the product of workplace abuse, deceptive social media manipulation, and games industry nepotism. It is baffling to comprehend why this game took so many years to be released, or why Alex kept delaying the game (oftentimes: without making any announcements!) since it was announced in 2022. The release date was only revealed WEEKS BEFORE RELEASE and the pricing has been kept secret (It’s TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS?!? This should have been a $4.99 mobile game). More on the game below, but keep reading for a comprehensive history of this title’s troubled development.

Starting development in 2021, Mythwrecked is a game that seems to be created out of generous art grants and expectations to keep receiving those grants. The developer hired a number of contractor employees to work on the game (no clue if they were paid), with the most interesting one being Malindy Hetfeld, a former coworker of Kim Belair. Malindy wrote the initial first draft of the game and seems to be a 1:1 model for the main character of Mythwrecked, Alex.
Tragically, Malindy would attempt to take her own life after a falling out with Alex and Polygon Treehouse. She was under the assumption that the writing position would lead to her being hired full time, which didn’t materialize and resulted in a number of extremely unsettling social media posts. Alex ignored all of these. Thankfully she received help/intervention and is still alive. At a March GDC event in 2023, Malindy was shocked to discover that she was banned from even entering the Mythwrecked booth, or promoting that she worked on the game. Frustrated, she vented that she wasn’t even sure how much of her original script was left in the game. It seems that Alex hired this contractor “narrative designer” simply to use her likeness and hard work, then distance himself to make HIS game look better. In a series of now deleted tweets on March 21st 2024, Malindy posted: “You know what, I’m gonna say this once and I don’t care who sees it, to be cut off from a game in such a way you don’t know it’s being shown off at GDC, literally while you’re there, f---ing sucks. I would’ve loved to be able to tell you about it. I would have loved to be able to tell you to go see it. Instead, I am now terrified of it myself, with no idea what, if anything, of my work remains. And that. F---ing. Sucks.” Followed by: “Sorry guys, I’m supposed to tell you that my words, aka the unedited first draft, are still in the game, haha, you can play Mythwrecked at the Expo floor at GDC, or not, I’m not the boss of you. I left Mythwrecked at a previously agreed to end date for my contract.”

Mythwrecked is a slow, boring, unimaginative game that has you solving puzzles meant for toddlers. Line up the lines to make the door unlock. Fetch the item for the Greek God. Run for long stretches of time with nothing happening. The start of the game is a complete joke: a boat animation is reused for the first 5 minutes, with a bad green filter, to convey that there’s a big storm…the development team must have run out of budget, because there’s a flash of white and the character is on the island. First impressions of the island: there is literal areas that are off the beaten path that look like they have secrets, only to have absolutely nothing. The island is lifeless, sterile, and boring. What’s the first observation to a nearby mysterious tower? “That’s a door!” Alex exclaims. Yes Alex, that IS a door! What insightful writing! The main character then tells you to check the wreckage for potential items to use. If you ignore this? The game gatekeeps you and tells you that you cannot proceed until you search the beach debris. What happens when you inspect the correct pile? “My phone is smashed! I better search the island for help.” NOW you can continue the game? Why did the developers insist on completing this tutorial, which teaches the player nothing? This isn’t helpful in a puzzle game: this is immediately annoying. Want to save your save or pass time at the benches? Sorry…you’ll need to travel ACROSS THE ISLAND to find a bench in a lighthouse to do those thing. You did? Great: NOW you can use those mechanics! What’s that? You want to change the time of day? Silly player…only DAWN is selectable for you now, other times of day are locked until you progress enough. Wouldn’t want to overwhelm the player with choices right away!

The character models are extremely disturbing. Their eyes look in random directions, with mouths opening to only give grunts, laughs, and giggles. Alex might have run out of funding, because seeing a paragraph of text appear on screen, only to have the character say “HAH!” is jarring and amateurish. When speaking with another character, they reuse the same animations over and over again. You’ll see the same mouth open/close reaction….about 20 times during a conversation with Hermes. These slack-jawed expressions are literally copy pasted between multiple characters. It seems like AI made them, with trying to appeal to early 2000’s Tumblr users.

Do you enjoy loading screens? How about every minute of gameplay? Mythwrecked will load each individual screen to achieve a Resident Evil-style camera angle, which becomes annoying quickly. In areas where the developers couldn’t figure out the camera? It awkwardly snaps to a different perspective, just like the original Resident Evil. This disjointed feel disrupts every single area of the game, as the developers didn’t think you deserved to be able to control the camera. To go from one puzzle to another, you might experience 6-10 “fade to black” loading screens. Just watch any streamer play the game and you’ll immediately notice there is TONS of map checking, running for long stretches of time, and zero things to keep you engaged (except for fruits in bushes! What does the fruit do? It’s used for fruit swapping with characters. What’s that? You want to fruit swap with Hermes? Nah: you need to increase your friendship level before you can swap fruit (“When we know each other better maybe we can swap fruit” ???). How do you increase your friendship level? You need to feed seagulls the fruit for a small increase: more busywork for you to do! The implementation is lazy: when leveling your friendship, the bar reaches the max (level 1 to level 2, for example), but the number doesn’t change…nothing. No, the game just tells you that your level increased in a separate line of dialogue. A more competent developer might include a flourish, or SHOWING that you leveled up the rank. Not in Mythwrecked!

The writing is awful. Simplistic and boring, the main characters observations will leave you dumbfounded. There’s a ruby at the top of a statue? And the main character can’t read the text? OK…oh, you found a statue with a sapphire gem? You get the EXACT SAME DIALOGUE, right down to the “I wish I could read this” sentence. There wasn’t ANYTHING ELSE that could have been put here? More descriptions of the gem? How long the text on the statue is? Nothing? Conversations are written like a bad visual novel: even the flirting comes off as wooden and lifeless. Don’t expect to romance those cute Greek gods though: these are strictly platonic friendships. This is not how characters talk: how did Alex make GREEK GODS boring to interact with? Characters react to your decisions, only to be caught in an endless loop of that animation until you continue. It’s funny to see a character step back in surprise, only to have that surprise (and lifeless eyes) cycle over and over again until you proceed.

It's fitting that Mythwrecked has “Ambrosia Island” in the game title. In Greek mythology, ambrosia is consumed by the Gods to grant immortality. This game will never achieve this, destined to be forgotten within an hour of you playing it. The game and developer are completely rotten to it’s core, like a discarded fruit on an island. Dear reader: save your money.

I have invested 7 hours into this game and can unequivocally endorse it.

One of the features I appreciate about this game is its unique reinterpretation of Greek mythology, which is presented in an innovative manner.

I remain engaged at all times due to the abundance of activities and exploration opportunities available.

I find the collectible elements particularly appealing, as well as the utilization of various tools associated with different deities to interact with the environment across the island; this has significantly maintained my intrigue and sustained my interest.

Only one bug I've experienced so far is some of the text sometimes gets jambled

----------
after thoughts

my goodness, i finished it and i cried, the plot twist!!

i need more, a sequel a dlc. i need more of these gods

-i love the character design
-dialogue
-the nicknames
-ending

Mythwrecked, was a game I was hyped yet skeptical about after playing the demo. After playing the game I would that it's inital tag of Puzzle-game is miss placed.
The depiction of the different Gods and Goddesses other than Aphrodite and maybe Hades is abysmal. Hera is left as Zues' side piece rather than a fully fleshed-out character. You don't meet all of the Gods of the main 12 and they all just sit there.
And if I have to pick one more golden apple I will riot.

Overall I think what makes me mad is that there was such potential with this game and it feels squandered. I think it would have been better described as an updated point-and-click type game. If you are tying to get your kid into reading maybe you could do this game. Maybe. But anyone who actually knows about Greek Mythology would be sorely disappointed by this game.

So far this game is way more than I expected! Cozy game with a fun fetch quest system that has me really hooked! Honestly an awesome game so far! I highly suggest it!

Also, they made Hermes man boobs bounce and I'm here for it.

I've really enjoyed this game so far - relaxed atmospheric setting, clean art style & enjoyable script. The game really helps you keep on track of the tasks and integrates an innovative "radar" mechanic that helps you to find objects so you don't get stuck. Its running flawlessly on linux for me through proton.

edit: I've played through now, it's a great game for adults and kids - a good family safe intro to greek gods and interesting story. Dialogue is well written to transfer the right knowledge and give a good picture of Ambrosia Island

I love how everything in this game has some kind of animation, ropes swaying in the wind and jars wobbling as you walk past. The characters are so much fun and remind me of Captain Planet for some reason lol, kind of a saturday morning cartoon vibe. Lots of stuff to collect and decorate your room with and it has a quest tracker like in RPG's. Really enjoying it so far :)

I'm gonna go with 'meh'. There's just.. not a lot of 'game' here. It's 100% fetch quests. I'd say I'm prolly not the target audience - it might be a better game for kids. That'd fit with the 'preachiness' of it (I don't mind that so much, although, uh, Ares' 'war was different back then' speech is pretty insulting to any actual scholar of history). I'm giving it a thumbs down largely because most of my friends are probably /also/ not the target audience - although again, maybe for their kids? (I'd pick Alba first, tho, if I'm looking for a kids learning game!)

A cozy, low-stress game in which you run around a small island talking to fun characters and fining things for the. The game takes about about 12 hours to 100%, which is about the right length in terms of running back and forth around the island finding things. Fans of Greek myth with find lots of allusions and direct references to mythic stories they know, as well as fun modern takes on the classic divine characters.

Honest not a bad game, it's a bit of a collectathon but very enjoyable.

My main gripe is that even if you set text speed to max, you still have to wait from display/un-display animation on every single line, it's infuriating. If the devs fix this i'd happy swap my review to positive

I'm still early in Mythwrecked but I can already tell that this game is just full of personality and charm. Nearly every object in the environment responds to your movement with playful animations, the characters are all unique and well fleshed out, the music is relaxing, the story and writing invite you to learn more, and the mechanics are expertly introduced so you're never overwhelmed (and I really appreciate the task list). I'm definitely looking forward to playing more and seeing where the story goes!

Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island is an amazing adventure game with so many QoL features. The game will tell you very clearly when you reach a point of no return and to save before that, so I would say it has no missable achievements unless you ignore that warning. Completion takes around 9 hours.

Approximate amount of time to 100%: Around 9 hours
Estimated achievement difficulty: 1/10
Minimum number of playthroughs needed: 1
Is there a good guide available: I wrote a this guide [www.missitheachievementhuntress.com]
Multiplayer achievements: No
Missable achievements: Technically yes, but the game very clearly warns you when you reach "the point of no return" and even advises you to save before that
Grinding Achievements: No
DLC-Only achievements: No
Speedrun achievements: No
Time-gated achievements: No
RNG-achievements: No
Does difficulty affect achievements: No difficulty setting
Unobtainable/glitched achievements: No


What an amazing game is Mythwrecked! You play as Alex who is stranded on this weird island where some particular people live, but something strange is going on. They don't remember the past or who they really are. They know they should do some tasks but also don't know why that is. You'll get to know them and help them while also trying to find a way to get home.

The gameplay loop in this game is that you help someone out with some tasks they have to do (cleaning up or repairing stuff) and find some mementos to trigger memories and try to cure their amnesia. Each character has 3 friendship levels, so you do this 3 times for all 8 characters.

I'm so impressed with how much eye for detail and Quality of Life features the developers added to this game. All the information you need can be found in the game. There is a map with so much details which will show you where to find every single thing. The map is clear in where you are right now. If you struggle with which mementos are for who, there is an NPC to give you hints about them. Another huge QoL feature is that there always is a save point very close by. They are literally all scattered over the island and those spots also let you choose the time of day. And last but not least, very early on you get the option to open up fast travel, which is very nice to have access to.

The only negative thing I could say about Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island is that I thought it was a bit confusing that you would get hints for mementos for places you can't reach yet because you're missing an ability. However, this will be quite clear when looking for that mementos and I know that the developers are thinking of changing this part. This critic is very minor and doesn't impact the game that much as you'll be running all over the island for other tasks as well. So you probably still need to be in that area for other tasks when you discover you can reach that mementos yet.

Achievement wise, the game can have some missable achievements. However, the game warns you very clearly when you reach the "point of no return" and even advises you to save before going further. As long as you do this you're safe and can continue what you missed after finishing the game. Most of the achievements you will already have unlocked by just playing through the story. The only recommendation I have while playing through the game is to pick up a lot of fruits, as there is an achievement for picking up 500 fruits. Completion takes around 9 hours if you take your time.


I give Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island 4,5 out of 5 stars.

This is a neat little collectathon game, but not much more, which is fine so long as you know what you're getting into. It's one of those sandbox games that keeps you in a small part of the sandbox until you progress the story enough to unlock the next area and then you have a larger and larger map to run around until you're done with the game. The unlock progress is decent and, while there is a lot of back and forth and a little bit done to, imo, stretch the runtime, but overall I don't feel like it's so egregious that I would rate it negative. Just know this is around a 10-15 hour experience with a lot of backtracking or teleporting around to talk to everyone and clean up everything that needs to be fixed or tidied up.

My biggest gripe with this game honestly is the style and I don't usually ever say something like that but I want to say it because I feel like the art can be off putting and it really is a wholesome and sweet game regardless of that. I'm not entirely sure where the idea came from to make all the Gods *very* different from their traditional looks AND also extremely off-putting at the same time but it really made me NOT want to play this at first. If not for the fact that I received this game for free I probably would have never played it, which is too bad because the time I did spend with it was nice.

Also, this game is not really a puzzle game. There's stuff to decipher/figure out with the Gods and their old, lost items and there are a few "puzzles" but they're pretty basic and feel like they were included just to add some gameplay, I think? I would strongly suggest this be removed from future games. I'm not sure who those are for and I would like to ask the developer to consider these things for their next game. What does that rudimentary puzzle do for anyone playing it? How does it challenge them? How does it add to the game? If you cannot answer these, as I feel you cannot with the current puzzle system, I don't really think it should be included. A small nitpick, as I said the puzzles are extremely easy and barely stop my progress, but something I would love to see addressed in all future games from this dev.

Like I said, overall it's a cute experience. The story is whole and nice and the writing isn't bad by any means and kept me interested in the mystery of the island. That said, it isn't perfect. There's a lot of repeat tasks you need to do, or a lot of gating your progress behind other tasks. I myself have yet to finish the game because it was getting a little boring for a stream and decided I would do it when I was feeling like a more chill experience. I still plan to do this, but I've been busy and haven't had the chance. If anything drastically changes between now and my finishing the game I'll update the review but for the time being I'd say I recommend it. $25 may or may not be steep for you, please just consider the value your put on easy, chill collectathon experiences and decide on your own. This is one where I don't think it's really too expensive by any means, but it is certainly a game the requires the right perspective.

Cheers and thanks for reading my review. If you'd like to see my curator page it's right here and included nothing but indies to enjoy. :)

Beautiful graphics animated with a lot of care, it's lovely to explore this cozy and charming world. Honestly feels like being on vacation with a bunch of wacky gods. (My personal fave is Aphrodite!)

Very polished and original take on classic Greek mythology in a wholesome and family-friendly package. The character designs are truly unique and the UI is thoughtfully designed, with a easy to navigate quest and map system so you're not lost at any point or tearing your hair out trying to find that one thing.

Ideal for those who want a stress-free experience in a classic adventure game format where you walk around, solve puzzles and chat to a pantheon of hilarious characters.

Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island is a fun, cozy, and above all fantastic adventure game set in the world of Greek mythology. It tackles important contemporary themes like self-acceptance, burnout, or connecting with others, and features great character dialogues to support these topics. Next to other Greek mythological games, like God of War, Immortals Fenyx Rising, or Hades, this is one that is intrinsically driven by characters, emotions, and exploration. Additionally, there is no violence, making it a very accessible and relaxing experience. The game also ran very smoothly for me, and features some nice extras for controllers (e.g., DualSense blinking and haptics that mimic the radar of the in-game Ambrosidex). Audiovisually, it's also a real treat.

A must play for fans of Greek myth and games, and completely recommended for those who enjoy cozy narrative games!

I received an early access review copy of this game for free but am not being paid for this review. This review has no story spoilers but does discuss gameplay mechanics and the premise of the game's story.
--
I enjoyed this game! I'd give it an 8/10 and would recommend it. Very cozy and cute. The characters are fun (and Hephaestus and Athena are SMOKIN' hot). The puzzles/tasks were very chill and it was satisfying to check off all the boxes. All in all, if you're looking for something really challenging this is not that game. But if you want something cozy and wholesome with a diverse array of hotties that will take at least 9-10 hours to complete, you're in for a treat.

There are two reasons I give this an 8/10 instead of a 10/10: (1) playing through it all in one sitting did end up feeling monotonous because you have to double back to the same spots soooo many times, and (2) the inter-character relationships felt forced at times because the player character was required by the story to act as "I'm the one who knows you the best, and I will remind you who you are"--which felt a little awkward since you've just met these people and presumably know that they're famously gods but don't know much about them at all personally, considering how much dialogue there is where you're trying to learn about the gods based on what they remember of each other.

Regarding (1): the fast travel points and shortcuts/abilities you unlock as the game progresses made it easier to get around and I was definitely grateful that they meant that not so much time was spent walking back and forth over the same areas. However, it was still a lot of walking. The amount of walking between places is really what made up the bulk of my 10 hours of gameplay. I think my preferred way to play this kind of game would be in smaller chunks of maybe an hour or two at a time to unwind, but even then I'd say it's an 8/10 when it comes to all the walking where there's nothing to discover along the way, it just takes that much time to get from point A to point B.

There's definitely enough content to complete several major tasks in an hour or two, and the way the game is structured means you'll know exactly where you left off and what you need to do next if you were to stop and pick it back up again later.

Regarding (2): as a narrative designer I appreciated the creativity that went into each islander's personality, origin story, and relationships with each other. The in-game universe makes implications about the gods and their flaws that make for interesting stories that are still family-friendly (which Greek mythology generally is NOT). That was an interesting take on Greek mythos that I think is fun whether or not you go in knowing anything about the classic myths. The plot twists towards the end had my jaw dropping!

The inter-character relationships feeling forced I think comes from some tricky prerequisites to the story that's being told in this game. It's not a small task to write "an outsider who is a mortal arrives and fixes some divisions in a family of immortals who have literally eons of beef and history", make those beefs minor enough for the gods to fix themselves given some nudging in the right direction, AND make it feel like your player character is learning things about the gods and their lives when you can't know how much info about Greek myth and history the player will have going in to the game. especially when the player's whole objective is to **remind the gods who they are**. To be totally clear, the writing is very well done considering what it needed to accomplish within the scope of the game. It's clear from the writing that a lot of consideration went into finding solutions for those problems and they did a fine job with it! It's just that the premise was a tricky one and maybe could have been refined at a conceptual level to head off some of those problems so the interactions between characters could feel a little more natural and less forced. 8/10 premise, 10/10 execution of the premise they were working with.

Additional notes:
As a game designer and game developer myself, I thought this game had some really neat features and appreciated the design choices that made the puzzles interesting even though they were not challenging. One thing I really appreciated from this game was the UI/UX and organization of information--the devs did a REALLY good job with this. It never felt like I was missing integral information, there was a narrative explanation for why I was able to keep track of all the things I learned and needed to do, and everything was organized really nicely. ADHD brain approves! Good design!!!

In terms of accessibility I was so glad there was a toggle to sprint button, especially considering how much of the game is just getting between places. Thank you, devs!

A small accessibility feature I'd like to see in a future patch is the ability to loop around when you LT/RT or LB/RB in menus--like when you go all the way to the right, it loops around to the first button on the left. That would have been really handy especially when referencing the gods' Ambrosidex entries (like Hades'--he's so far over there!)

TL;DR: I wish I hadn’t fallen asleep during Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island so I could quit before hitting the 2-hour mark and refund it. Not worth your time or money—even at 70% off. I wasted both (technically, time was mine and the money was my husband's) so you don’t have to. Go read the negative reviews; they’re all true.

The colossal disappointment that is Mythwrecked deserves to be studied. Greek mythology, alongside the Bible, is one of the richest sources of inspiration for European culture. It’s endlessly fascinating, brimming with intrigue, and has captivated generations. Everyone knew that one kid obsessed with Greek or Roman gods. (If you knew me, that kid was me.) So how do you take this treasure trove of storytelling and make it… boring? I didn’t think it was possible, but Mythwrecked managed to pull it off.

I played the demo a few months ago. It was… underwhelming, but I figured it was incomplete. I wasn’t sold on the creative direction—modernized gods? Fine. Alternative haircuts and less conventional looks? Sure. But Hermes in a comically small speedos? The gods’ faces straying into uncanny valley territory? The whole vibe felt… off. Still, I held onto hope. Maybe the full release would improve things. Surely, they wouldn’t release a game in that state without further refinement. Right?

Reader, they did release it in that state.

The story is barely a story—more like a draft. It’s shallow, with dialogue so uninspired I ended up skipping through it (and I never skip dialogue; I read everything). The graphics are unimpressive at best, actively frustrating at worst. Once the sun sets, good luck distinguishing paths from walls (sometimes invisible ones!). The gameplay? Imagine a DoorDash simulator where you’re the dasher, your clients don’t know what they want, and instead of getting paid, you pay them with fruit. If that’s not bad enough, every character seems determined to overcomplicate everything. The game forces you into an infuriatingly rigid progression system that feels less like playing and more like enduring.

And the puzzles (more like a puzzle). If you’re over the age of three, you’ll find them insulting.

The cherry on top is the sound design. The characters’ grunts, moans, and monosyllabic exclamations are a special kind of torture. I don’t expect every game to have full voice acting, but please, don’t make me sit through Aphrodite moaning and bouncing her... chest while talking about gardening.

I wish I could say I quit, but no—I fell asleep (the background music is soothing) and by the time I woke up, it was too late for a refund. I finished the game out of morbid curiosity, and I can confidently say it’s an overpriced piece of garbage that never should’ve been released in this state.

For a deeper dive into what went so horribly wrong, I highly recommend Randy Savage Brother’s review. It’s an excellent analysis of this disaster. Honestly, read that—and all the other negative reviews—before considering buying this game. They’re painfully accurate.

Mythwrecked is a breath of fresh air - such a calm, pleasant world to explore and lots of simple, juicy interactions scattered everywhere. I'm engrossed in the mystery already, and every new character I meet is such a joy to chat with.

This is a game for completionists who like a healthy todo list to work through, and if you want an irreverent, cheeky take on old myths and legends these gods are a riot. Strong recommendation!

It's a gentle, charming game in which you wander round a sandy island finding strangers with the names of Greek gods and helping them regain their memories. Starting slow, it offers a calm pleasurable experience, with simple puzzles and tasks which gradually build up to a moderately intense final section. I really enjoyed the game process, and the way in which it teaches you about the ancient Greeks, their gods and their history. By the end I'd become quite fond of some of them. It took me 15 hours to finish the game. A lot of time is spent reading.

Recommended if you just want something very cozy that's close to a visual novel. The gameplay is very easy and the puzzles are really light. I had a nice time with it, but there isn't much gameplay, it's an extremely cozy experience.

Dang, I really enjoyed this game. A perfect pick-up-and-play for when I didn't feel like digging into anything too deep/overly complicated. The narrative and characters are super sweet, their designs are unique, and the themes discussed were comforting and affirming. I highly recommend at least giving the demo a try, and seeing if it's the sort of thing you'd enjoy.

The gameplay itself is pretty light; there are no real puzzles to speak of. You speak to a character, find out what you need to accomplish to "level" your friendship with them, then you travel to places marked on the map to activate those things, then repeat. As you collect more things and unlock more friendship levels more parts of the map become unlocked, and more characters. You won't have to think too hard to work out how to progress; if you're stuck with levelling friendship with one character, it's usually because you've forgotten to do something clearly marked or you have to progress with a different character first. That makes progressing through the game pretty linear, but it works with the narrative.

I can see how the gameplay would be boring or repetitive for some, especially for anyone looking for a challenge, but for those who want an easy diversion with a lovely story, do give it a shot. Wholesome as heck, and very enjoyable, also easy to get all the achievements in a single playthrough. I hope you give it a try!

I am enjoying it so far, especially as story-rich exploration games are my jam. It has a really nice cozy vibe to it, and a really great tool (Ambrosidex) to track your progress, map, etc. Hoping to eventually finish it! Here's my first impressions:

I played this over a couple of days from start to finish. I liked every bit of the game. It was relaxing and fun. No rush or hassle. The story was intriguing, the graphics delightful, the characters quirky and charming at the same time, and the music unobtrusive. Simply put cozy!

After being shipwrecked on Ambrosia Island you run around helping out the gods/goddesses that have lost their memories. You build up trust (friendship) by scouring the island for their items to help them remember, collect fruit to trade with them and talk to them and others along the way. The puzzles are very simple and are assigned only to when you put the seals in the doors to open up them to other areas. You can collect crates that wash up on shore to decorate you own little area (lighthouse).

I recommend this game for family fun, down time or just to relax.

I had a lot of fun working through this game! The island is beautifully designed, the characters are a lot of fun, and I loved unravelling the story. There's some really clever tricks built into the game design that just made it feel so fluid! 10/10, was able to pet the doggo.

Played for 10 hours so far and not quite done. I enjoy the lore and setting the most and think the interpretation of the Olympians is very well done. I'm sure the type of repetition with tasks may bother some people but of a game this length, it doesn't bother me. It can be rather hard on my ADHD to constantly have a barrage of tasks so I got sidetracked pretty easily. But honestly...my brain was ok with it. All in all, a fun game.

Picked up the game and I was having so much fun that I played it for 7 hours straight for my first play session 😂 I really really loved the game play loop and it kept me hooked, alike to how it feels when trying to put down a really good book but just...become unsuccessful LOL. I'm currently playing Persona 3 Reload as well so ranking up with those characters felt alike to raising the friendship level with the gods in the game and it's a really fun and satisfying process. My heart is also v soft for a lot of the gods too, especially coming from the perspective of growing up with the Percy Jackson books 🥺❤

The game had a really wonderful balance of the heart warming moments, sad/emotional moments, and silly moments. It also felt very human despite being a story based in mythology and I really loved that. I loved how human the gods felt despite well, being gods. And the themes that were touched upon are a lot of themes that I currently really embrace close to my heart and are working towards trying to be better about and I just ahhhhh love it all so much!! I love how accessible this game was and was incredibly rewarding to finish!

Overall/TLDR, if you like games with a game play loop of exploring with little puzzles and a story intertwined with unlocking more lore and learning about characters, Mythwrecked is a wonderful game that I def recommend! 💖

I wasn't sure about the art style at first, but it looks great in motion.

I love the modern reinterpretation of the gods, it feels both true and fresh at the same time. Visual novels aren't usually a good fit for me. But I deeply enjoyed talking to all the characters and I had a smile on my face almost the entire time.
The chores you have to do for the gods aren't herculean epics, but rather quirky nods to each god's aspect. I loved them.

You have to be aware though that you will have to run back and forth across the island a lot. The game lore gives a reason for why you continually have to walk past quest items or revisit areas, but it is obvious artifical gating and it feels like it. If you are easily frustrated by backtracking, this game isn't for you.
For me, the beauty of the island and especially the soundtrack made up for it. I can highly recommend the chill-out spots and I wish the soundtrack was available as DLC.

While I would have liked full voice acting, focusing on some key phrases was probably a good compromise between cost/effort and giving the characters personality.

The game runs on a 24h cycle, but you can save anytime, pass in-game time, and you can't miss anything.

I didn't like the concept involved in the story conclusion, but I chalk that up to personal taste. It made sense and was well executed.

Overall, I really liked the game, it's worth checking out if you are in the mood for some heavenly housekeeping.

Its a narrative puzzle game, similar to Syberia. But here we stay on one island and it's a bit simpler puzzles than the Syberia series (thank goodness). It has a wonderful soundtrack which makes it really a good relaxation-game. I didn't encounter one single bug! Sometimes the progression for one character is blocked by a progression thing from another character maybe a bit too often. But that's really the only downside. Some voiced words here and there but no full dialogues. Kinda helps with the whole relaxing-theme.
Changes in the world are visual too which is nice.
The only thing I would like to have different would perhaps be the lights actually casting light so there'd be shadows too from it. I think it would have made it just slightly more fancy.
This is definitely a must-play for those who enjoy relaxing, beautiful music, easy puzzle games!
The characters you meet have a modern, fun and cool twist!

Alex, a shipwrecked backpacker finds herself on an island populated by the Ancient Greek gods who have, unfortunately, forgotten who they are or that they have godly responsibilities. Alex, a naturally helpful person, sets about remedying this by befriend the gods, talking through their problems, and doing favours for them. In practise it's a really nice collectathon-y exploration game (think A Short Hike in terms of difficulty and cosy vibes) with a smart premise. There's great character design giving a modern take on the ancient gods, and while if you're a purist who for some reason takes the Greek myths extremely seriously it's probably not for you, I think things like Poseidon being a chill sort of beach bum but with gills is pretty funny. Not taxing, but definitely relaxing, and the story and themes make it totally appropriate for kids too.

This game was such a cozy comfort. The writing was particularly compassionate and touching, and I found myself deeply invested in each of the characters' stories. There's a lot of running back and forth and all over, but there are fast travel portals to ease that journey. There weren't any janky moments or bugs for me, and I found the quick fruit picking as you ran past to be smart and smooth. The music was calming and enjoyable. Just a really pleasant experience as a game all around. I loved it.

When I played the demo I really liked the game play, art style and graphics. When it released, I bought this game on sale. I do recommend playing this game, however it can feel a little redundant on the quests. Puzzles weren't much in the game and they were very simple to solve. This is a cozy and slow paced game...I enjoyed the cassette tapes and listening to the music whenever chilling on the seated pillows. Okay game and would still recommend but buy it when it's on sale.

This is a lovely cosy game where you build friendships with the gods to progress. I like the "ambrosidex" function to keep track of where I am in the game (map wise and story wise). Similar to Roki in art work and game design, except on a mythic island rather than Scandinavia. Recommend

If I wanted to knit pick I'd say it can be a little repetitive and I wish the characters had more dialogue. But I don't really have a true negative comment. Definitely pick this one up for a casual session. :)

Really lovely game, and a great way to spend some relaxing game time. Chilled ambience and fun characters make the puzzle solving a pleasure. If you were a fan of cosy exploration games you will more than enjoy whiling away the hours playing Mythwrecked. Also non-violent and great for younger players.

I haven't played too much Mythwrecked, but it feels like a soft and chill kind of game for those new to myth stories looking for low pressure gaming. I appreciate the new take on these characters, although it does feel jarring to go from Hades to this... but, it's cute, especially if you aren't already attached to different incarnations of the gods.

I wish the camera would allow for more freedom, and that the main character would stop giving everyone the same horrified look while talking. Overall, pretty game with soft art style, it's got plenty of quirky characters and a possibly fun amount of gathering and (if you squint at it) puzzle-work.

I feel that I need to play a bit more before I give my final review, but it seems like it has potential.

I really had fun playing this game, it is an exploring, collecting, and friendship making game. I never felt stuck or frustrated, and it was a nice gentle play through. There is no time constraints to the game play, you can take your time with out penalties.
The only thing I would change is to take away the markers on the map and make the player find everything on their own. This would have been a great optional feature.
I like the character design, the premise, and highly enjoyed the graphics. I would recommend this game for anyone looking for a fun, gentle and non-violent game and those who love Greek mythology. Suitable, I think, for most anyone.

If you're looking for a relaxing game with some great graphics and music then you need to take a look at Mythwrecked. I have quite a way to go yet but I am intrigued as to what has been going on on this island and who else Alex is going to meet. The puzzles are easy, so far at least, but that fits with the vibe of the game. Alex actually does get time to just relax and listen to music at certain locations.
There's a lot of exploration, and looking for items, also feeding some seagulls. It's not a game to stress over and start raging when you wipe on a boss, it's the opposite and a good example of a chill game.

Adding another note now it's complete. The story is engaging, the characters we meet do deserve and receive our sympathy, and I like how it ends, no spoilers though. I've put quite some time in on my own vacation while trying to recover from burnout and it's been a good game for that.

Nice work on the models for Hermes and Po ;)

Going to ignore some of the crazy reviews on here and say I loved this game! I discovered it via a upcoming cozy games video and added it to my wishlist, I totally forgot about it until steam alerted me it had been released. Was such a fun game to play and I'm such a greek astrology nerd so this game was perfect! I really enjoyed searching for the mementos, almost feels like it would be a good dungeon crawler game, like one dungeon per god (coming from someone who hates dungeon crawlers)
Overall loved this game and deffo would reccommend for anyone who wants a shorter length story game

This would be a fun game for those who enjoy treasure hunting and collecting. There is about 8 hours of game play. I liked the island design and the chill atmosphere, the music and sound effects are so relaxing and suit the vibe.

However the game wasn't perfect; the game could use more humour. Considering the quirky character designs I thought it would be a light-hearted game I could get a giggle from, but a lot of the dialogue discusses emotional vulnerability. Speaking of character designs, imo most of the female characters look (and sound) a bit like Gods instead of Goddesses. Unsure if this was intentional de-feminisation by the dev.

I've been waiting for Mythwrecked to come out for a while; since I went to a convention and met the people at the White Thorn booth, as it happens. It was well worth the wait. While the price is a little steep, I did get a solid 8 hours of playtime in a game that keeps you moving and interested the entire time. It's essentially a massive fetch quest, which, when you think about it, many games are. You go between areas on an increasingly accessible map and collect items to give to characters that actually have quite a bit of depth. The main character moves at a decent pace, and the currency is regularly placed enough that it doesn't feel tedious, since you can just pick it up as you go. And you will need to pick it up, if you want to get all the trinkets and some bonus lines.
This take on mythological origins isn't one I've seen very often, and I appreciate that while the main character isn't an absolute mythology nerd, she at least has a passing familiarity with the Greek gods. It does a great job at showing what becomes of the gods when their roles have become more difficult to perform and their believers have faded.
Nice music, smooth gameplay, I don't believe I saw any typos, entertaining characters, solid story. I strongly recommend.

I enjoyed this little game, it's supposed to take around 8 - 10 hours depending on the person, I finished it with all achievements in just under 8 hours. It was a simple little exploration game, most of the fun comes from what essentially amounts to a scavenger hunt and talking to the characters. Don't come here expecting difficult puzzles or anything too deep, it's just a nice chill little time.

The art style isn't for everyone but it's charming for the most part. The camera is easily the worst part of the game, no question. It doesn't seem to know what it wants to do in certain areas, but I didn't think it was a deal breaker, just very odd from time to time. All in all, nice little game. I don't know if i'd call it a $25 game, but here we are.

I'm really enjoying the game so far. It's a charming world to spend time in with a welcoming art style and a tranquil soundtrack. It's clearly been made with a lot of heart and it really is the definition of a cosy game. It would make a great family game too with some light puzzle work and a compelling mystery that keeps you wanting to know more.

I highly recommend this if you're looking for a calming game to relax with.

Mythwrecked is such a delightful, chill game with some really interesting characters and a story set up which is very compelling. It feels like the sort of thing you would want to play on a relaxing Sunday evening.
I'm a big fan of the visual style too, which has a lineage to the developers previous game Roki (another game you should play!) and I'm looking forward to seeing more.

TLDR; only a couple of hours in but it's really nice and fun!

I am always in search for beautiful new indie games to play and the brand new Mythwrecked: Ambrosia Island has been a very charming Treasure Hunting game. The game will get quite repetitive after hours of searching for treasure and I did find myself getting a bit bored.

I personally love playing Treasure Hunting games and had a great time with Mythwrecked but again it got repetitive fast. The game is very well designed and I loved the graphics and feel of the game.

A good 10-12 hours of 100%-ing your way through the content. Very chill, easy to pick up and play, and just outright cozy. Never experienced any performance issues at 1080p on a very low-end PC and never faced a crash either. You'll know whether you like it within the 2 hour refund window for sure.

This game does have some flaws - the gameplay is repetitive, the story is kinda flimsy, and there's a big info-dump at the end. However, its great for a very non-challenging chill feel-good game. If you need something to just absolutely relax to, like a sick day or de-stress game session, this is a great one for that purpose.

Cute narrative adventure game about exploring an island and mending a modern interpretation of greek gods. It's cozy, it's pretty, and just a calming kinda game.

Great game for just escaping from reality for a few hours. Island exploration meets visual novel.
Overall themes of kindness, self-care and helping others paired with the interesting art style makes this a great cosy game to lose yourself in.

The game is a like a short summer holiday. And that is exactly what it is about too. it is a very laid-back affair, a stress-free game that isn't too challenging. It's perfect to play over multiple sessions, as you cannot really get stuck or lost, the game supports your journey at every step.

The fun is in exploring the island and finding new characters. There is so much stuff to find and a few surprises along the way.

I will still be picking ambrosia fruit in my dreams.

Mythwrecked is a gem! Ambrosia Island is a wonderful place to escape to. There's a relaxing rhythm to things as you explore and discover its secrets and residents. The art direction is gorgeous, the pastel colours giving the island giving an ethereal feel and establishing a great sense of place. You're never overwhelmed by the exploration either, with the map slowly opening up new locations as you progress.

You've never seen the Greek Gods like this before! There's much whimsical charm here. Frequently I found myself chuckling along to our conversations, with each character granting as many new questions as they do answers.

I also think this would be a wonderful family game played together. There's depth here, with lot to think about beyond merely solving puzzles to progress. The player is prompted to feel genuine concern for those you're helping, and to react to their honesty and warmth as they slowly open up to you in surprising ways. You'll start by thinking about how to help yourself, but very soon be absorbed by helping others.

Overall one of the most unique and charming games I've played in a very long time! Highly recommended.

Mythwrecked is a cozy sandbox fetch quest game featuring the ancient Greek mythology. Yes, I was instantly sold and couldn't wait to play immediately on release. Overall, Mythwrecked is a solid game with a cute story and cozy gameplay. The only thing to improve would be additional voice acting for the characters and their lines, which would seal the deal for an indie game. Highly recommend for the cozy gamers! You can also pet the "dog(s)"!

The game's a fun - though very short - romp around an island chatting to characters with names from Greek myth, though not exactly their personalities. The gameplay loop can get very repetitive - you're just speaking to people and then going to look for the items they tell you to, all of which you'll be directed to by your map so you'll never not know where to go - but the vanishingly short run time (about 9hrs to 100% even if you're taking it easy) means it doesn't overstay its welcome. There are a lot of indicators for just how small the team who worked on this game is, like not being able to walk up even the smallest of ledges, but again it's not a major detriment to your experience. I wouldn't advise going in thinking this will be some sort of Palia/Animal Crossing/Stardew Valley concept with Greek characters in it or you'll be disappointed, but if you want to explore a beautiful island and meet some fun characters along the way, it's not a bad choice.

Lovely relaxing game about hanging out on a beautiful island dripping with pastel gorgeousness, discovering and interacting with modern reinterpretations of mythical Greek gods, and generally having a cozy ol' good time.

I've been super stressed out with very scary stuff happening in my country for the past few days, and playing Mythwrecked is like a breath of fresh air and a serene meditation session combined. It delivers a very satisfying effect of peacefulness through a stress-free, take-your-time-and-collect-stuff game loop, sharp flatly colored polygons, very expressive character animation, and relaxing, chill background music that drifts from epic discovery to silky bossanova. Good stuff!

As an artist I have to give a huge shoutout to the exquisite eye candy that is the lighting system that changes based on the time of day. Whether it's the warm pinks of dawn or the blueish shades of evening, it nails atmosphere with very few means and maximum effect. And atmosphere is my core interest when playing this kind of game. And, yes, it has that in spades.

Can't wait to discover more of the island, more gods, more secrets. Big double thumbs up from me!

Absolute gem of a game. The more you play, the more you get drawn in. It's gorgeous to look at, relaxing to play but still challenging. It's got that immersion factor where you feel like you're in another world. The artistic design and animation are spot on. The attention to detail in the environments and the characters is really impressive. The more you play, the more you notice.
Money well spent and looking forward to uncovering all the secrets the game has up it's sleeve.
If you like adventure type games which really draw you in and make you determined to discover everything, you'll love it.
It's polished and professional, not half finished like some of the rot out there.
