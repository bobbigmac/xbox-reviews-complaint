OK
Peaceful exploration game, pleasant enough. But dreadful voice acting, zero challenge, and something about the way the characters are drawn is deeply disturbing.

Disregard any positive reviews
My hope was this would be another Stardew, or even a Coral Island clone, but sadly this is just a safe, souless, "modern audience" cashgrab that is only being reviewed highly by the devs and their bot accounts.

It's one of those cozy games. Made slightly less cozy by the psychotic eyes. Every character looks like they've seen something terrible and they can't forget it. It was probably this game.

I really don't understand all the hate on this game. I really enjoyed it. Really nice exploring game with cartoony graphics. Where on earth this issue of DEI is coming from I've no idea? Is this just the usual- it's not a triple A game so let's pick it apart?! Played on a standard xbox1 I had no glitches or issues with all 1000pts popping.

Chilled out, quirky, no challenge at all!
I had no expectations of this game but, I actually enjoyed it. The characters are quirky and funny, the conversations and mannerisms were entertaining. There is no challenge in the game whatsoever and I don't think there was intended, it just a relaxed adventure. Having said that I'm only playing it on game pass and would never buy a game like this, there is no replay value. It makes me think of point n click adventures, except there is nothing cryptic or puzzling about the tasks you need. If you're feeling tired or ill and just fancy a game that's relaxing with no challenge but entertaining then I would recommend if the price is at least 50% off.

The simglish voices make it feel cheap, but if you like low stakes and chill vibes (like a Short Hike), with relaxing music and basic collectathon/friendship levels (and can play as a black woman, unlike the sad 1 star triggered culture war losers who review bomb this stuff), this is a pretty good time. The biggest complaint I have is the dialogue delay makes it feel sluggish, so long conversations drag on. Lmao at the dude complaining the greek gods aren't realistic enough lol

Firstly, dont edit options before first save at a bench as game will crash.
You wash up on a greek island, meet gods and do quests for them and find hidden items to get soul stones to fix the gia tree and save the isand to be able to escape.
People are abit woke and drawn awful but the over all story was decent by the end.

The game starts of with your average adventure start and story then turns into a grind of "do thing, find thing, repeat three times" this is the same for literally every character. I would not buy this game, however it's free gs on gamepass

The game is fine
Most reviews claiming dei are just review spamming to push a political agenda. Almost all the character designs are a resonable interpretation of what the helenic gods could look like in the modern world. The only character design that I have an issue with is that Hermes, the god of travalers and thieves, messenger of the gods, is fat. A reasonable interprotation might of been an athlete or someone that is thin and crafty. If you can ignore the existance of a fat character by using the excuse of magic and divine powers, then you might enjoy this game for what it is, a calm game about living on an island you've been shipwrecked on with collectables and simple puzzles.

Hugely enjoyable adventure game, highly recommended
Intriguing completely original storyline, gorgeous animation. Calming atmospheric soundtrack. The attention to detail is lovely and the longer you play, the more you notice. I haven't played another game where progression is linked to your level of friendship with characters. And not just ordinary characters as you'll see but not going to spoil that for you as that's a big part of the fun. What really sets this apart in my opinion is the genuinely original storyline and social interaction between your character Alex, and the other main characters. In terms of the difficulty level of the puzzles, so far i find it pleasantly challenging, but slightly easier than Roki (which I definitely recommend if you missed it on release). If you've played older adventure games going back to eg the secret of monkey island, this game takes some influence but at same time, feels fresh and modern. Takes 20 mins playtime before depth and complexity become apparent
