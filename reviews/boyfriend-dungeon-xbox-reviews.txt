Okay
Some interesting ideas, a good entry-point to the genre but there are many better alternatives if you already like dungeon crawlers. So saccharin it gave me diabetes. Good if you liked Coffee Talk or Daddy Dating.

Good roguelike with likable characters.
There isn't a lot of depth in Boyfriend Dungeon but that can be a good thing. Long doesn't always = better Effectively 100% the game in one day, 7/8 hours. 
Each character has good depth and traits that pushed me towards completing all their individual stories. I like a couple more than the others but that's a good thing, I think most will find at least one of the dateable weapons to love, either narratively or mechanically.
It's a fun game to play in the dungeons too, I'd describe it as Hades-lite. There isn't much depth to the combat but with only two full dungeons to fight through that's not the end of the world.
All in all a fun experience, exactly what I have gamepass for.

Fun little dungeon crawler
Really enjoyable dungeon crawler with a diverse and entertaining cast of characters. A bit on the short side (around 6 hours to fully complete 3 characters and get credits rolling), but when it's included in Game Pass, it's hard to complain too much about the length.

Amazing dating sim
While there were some parts i found confusing, like Rowan being referred to as they/them, which made me think it was talking about Rowan and Crowley.
However, the range of personality of the characters made me want to know more about them. Except Eric,  which is perfect for what he is. The ending seemed a bit fake though, i find it hard he fully charged.
The game would have been boring without the dungeons for me, so glad they were included.
I wish the ending showed you being back home, because it felt incomplete without it. Loved the game though, it has many opportunities for a sequel.

I would never have tried this if not for game pass. This had good reviews and the premise was quite weird so I gave it a whirl and enjoyed it.

Fantastic
This is a fantastic game and I'm glad I got to experience it.  Each character have a wonderful uniqueness to them and I full appreciate that you can have a wonderfully platonic friendship instead of a love ship.
I ADORE the transformation sequences and I wish there is some place where I can just re-watch them all xD
My only sadness with this game is that I completed the final battle but once you do that, I couldn't access the shop to get the plastic I believe it is for me to make the last, like... two items.  That sucked but apart from that very minor grievance, 
10/10 Will play again!
SPOILERS BELOW
So I was just minding my own business leveling up Val when I notice a certain mansion at the top of the map and I'm introduced to Rowan.  My heart never became so conflicted so quickly.  I didn't know how to take into the final battle with me! (ended up being Rowan)

Haven't had my fill
Soundtrack amazing, great visuals, characters... eh- rough, tropes, but entertaining nonetheless.
Not a fan of how little impact you'll have on some characters and the outcome (for example; Sunder) is dead set into one.
I just got into the combat aspect but felt it got snuffed out real soon as there's only 2 dungeons to dive into with one last boss fight. Everything's more rushed as soon as you get the bonus status 2x exp increase in affinity once you hit max affinity with any of the characters.
It makes more sense to date them all at once since I can't imagine fighting the same 2 old dungeons over 7 times can be fun, so that makes it a bit awkward to indulge in on the open relationships.
My appetite has been stimulated, but definitely not satisfied.

Great Game Wonderful Experience
I wasn't sure at first if I would be able to get into this. Dating sims are not my thing, and I'm not great at combat in this way usually. That all changed within the first hour of playing though. The story is very well written, the characters are varied and fun to hang around with. The feelings I had toward each character was all very real, both positive and negative feelings. I will play through again at least one more time. 5* absolutely deserved. Well done Kitfox.

Relaxing Twist On A Dungeon Crawler
So I'm a fan of both dungeon crawlers and visual novels/dating sims. This was really well done, both in the combat, which was fun and silly, with new dungeons and enemies to keep things fresh, and with the story. It's premise is simple, spending a summer with your cousin and looking for love. But the idea that your (spoiler!) swords are also people, that you can date, is both hilarious and entertaining. It's a great take on the classic dating sim tropes, and I really loved the way the characters stories were fleshed out by spending time with them both in the dungeon and on dates. I loved the character customisation - it's simple, but picking outfits was really fun, and I looked forward to new recipes to craft gifts and clothes. Overall, it was really well done. My only complaint is that it's short - I got through it in a day, but it does have high replayability, so that speaks for itself.

Transforming swords
Well from what i can read on reviews some people played others had the attention span of a fly in a blender. Gameplay is based on leveling system so there will be a grind. 3 achievements still missing but hidden areas may of been missed in last locations. The humour is enjoyable and to be honest ive heard worse said when family have have been on roblox with the whole stuck step sis. If your game is gta or cod maybe not for you as would mean reading dialogue. Either way there is no gender on main character but there is also a female character and even a ummm cat which ends up being a weapon. Give it 20 minutes if not for you move on also if it was doki. Doki no one would complain due to awareness.  For a indie time feedback is key for growth.

A nice game with potential!
From the get go the concept of this game seemed hilariously strange, however this initial interest allowed me to get hooked by the dungeon gameplay mechanics and interesting leveling system. The cast of love interests are diverse and most have enjoyable relationship progression! However, i found the game to be very short, there are only two dugeons in the whole game with around 12 floors each. The storyline also felt a little underdeveloped, both with the individual characters (only 6 dates per character) and the main story. Though this game felt short, i still finished wanting more! I see great potential in this game which i feel could be reached in some sequel or new game with more dugeon content (perhaps more dugeon variety too, such as the trap rooms) and deeper relationship development with concequences for dating more than one person. Again, still loved this game and couldn't stop playing until I had finished it (just wish it was longer!)

This game is alright it's a dungeon crawler with a difference, your boyfriend transforms into a sword what is there not to like (Lots of people have that fetish).  This game clearly isn't for children any doofus can see that so why the poor ratings, I'll tell you what I think shall I.  This game features men and because the majority of gamers are male, I have the distinct impression that all of those bad ratings were from homophobes.  It quite easy to fix this, if you're homophobic stay away end of.

If you want to read a book, read a proper book. If you want to play a game, play something else. Boring.

what did i just play?
probably a divisive game simply because of the story material. it's a simple dungeon clawling story game. i finished it at least, once, which is more then i can say for other games on gamepass.

We Need More Games Like This!!
First of all i love everything about this game. Secondly the gameplay is adorable and the story is amazing. My favourite romance was Rowan, i love a dark, broody character like that who turns out to be such a sweetheart.

Good game, but some things throw me off
This game has some great n fast paced dungeon crawling gameplay that can be mixed up with a variety of weapons and customisation, while also being blended together with a dating sim aspect that allows you to to get some backstory on characters. If you are looking for a good Rogue Like or need a game similar to Hades, then you might enjoy this game for the dungeon gameplay but you dating sim peeps? Not really honestly, furthermore, I have a few issues with game, those being the short length of the game that makes the final act feel rushed, most choices had no actual impact on what happens, cringe worthy dialogue on occasion, a literal child as a usable weapon/date option and a cat that follows the same lines as the kid. I did opt to ignore those latter issues for the reasons of it being just wrong but eh. In conclusion, a solid game but not worth the price, use game pass to play it if you wanna try it.

Great music, story and gameplay
The game starts when you arrive in seaside town for the summer holidays,you are introduced to other male,female and non binary characters who also have the abilty to transform ito different weapon types which you can use in dungeons.  The dungeons are themed on your fears.  As your charater levels up so too will your weapons offering opportunities to meet them for dates.
The 1‚≠ê reviews seem rather unfair and actually very similar in content... So ignore them.  
You start the game creating your character and can be male, female or non binary.  Datable chars can also be just friend through dialouge choices.
The dungeons are fun.  Challenging ar the start but do become easier when you reach higher levels.
Monsters drop ingredients for crafting and money to buy more ingredients or clothes.... Some have benefits.

Wish the story contiued so i could find out what happened to everyone... Especially Seven!

Short but Sweet
I loved this game, seriously loved it. It's pretty inclusive and respectful of the lgbt+ community (me being part of it) although there are some common but understandable tropes. Wish the final bug racing achievement wasn't so hard but oh well. Lasted me about 8 hours to 100% it (except the racing minigame). Definitely a 5/5

Absolutely loved it.
loved how you could choose your gender to be non binary and date others who are the same and generally being inclusive to lgbt+. ignore what the low ratings say thy are spouting nonsense like they havent played it being all childish with it. really hope the makers do another dungeon game or dating sim mix. <3

One of the best games i have ever played
this is really just one of the best games i have ever played from start to finish, i loved i love the characters and the combat is very different and i like the different ways that you can play depending on the weapon, i understand that the levels do feel a wee bit the same, but the enemies are really good and they fit in with the area that you are in, looking back at it i wish the game was a bit longer, but at the end i knew that it was a good place to end it, all i can say is try the game and i hope that they do something to add to the story like a different game or DLC to add to the game.

Anti woke baiting confusion
Eh? This must really get some people riled, thats not the point surely üòâ. Life simulator *** hack em up confusion. Well presented with good sfx and middling gfx. Unintentionlly funny at times but must be the most middle class game ive ever played. Give it a go though if its your sort of thing.

Worthy for the name alone
Fun and weird games are what keep the gaming industry alive and versatile. This one's fun - though a little easy - and weird - but you should've gotten that from the title. If you get bent out of shape by 'woke' or 'political' characters, you're gonna miss out on a whole lot of enjoyable games in the years to come.

Shame its got this weird creepy story line, actually has a good dungeon crawler gameplay. 
Not sure what the developer was thinking.
Has potential for a good game if they got rid of the dating element.

Solid funny unique game.
Ignore or laugh at the fragile boys reviews mad about a game being inclusive. Beta af. The games solid and interesting mix of dating and rpg dungeon crawl. Wholesome, comedic and unique. If you're not an easily offended beta against inclusivity, id recommend giving it a try. 4.5/5.
Cope harder "Gamers".

Meh
Creepy cousin Jesse got the game off to a dubious start but it was the terrible gameplay in the "dunj" that led to a rapid uninstall.
